We present comprehensive protein quantitative trait locus (pQTL) mapping of 2,923 proteins that identifies 14,287 primary genetic associations, of which 81% are previously undescribed, alongside ancestry-specific pQTL mapping in non-European individuals. The study provides an updated characterization of the genetic architecture of the plasma proteome, contextualized with projected pQTL discovery rates as sample sizes and proteomic assay coverages increase over time. We offer extensive insights into trans pQTLs across multiple biological domains, highlight genetic influences on ligand–receptor interactions and pathway perturbations across a diverse collection of cytokines and complement networks, and illustrate long-range epistatic effects of ABO blood group and FUT2 secretor status on proteins with gastrointestinal tissue-enriched expression. We demonstrate the utility of these data for drug discovery by extending the genetic proxied effects of protein targets, such as PCSK9, on additional endpoints, and disentangle specific genes and proteins perturbed at loci associated with COVID-19 susceptibility.

We utilized levels of human blood plasma proteins originating from specific organs to measure organ-specific aging differences in living individuals. Using machine learning models, we analysed aging in 11 major organs and estimated organ age reproducibly in five independent cohorts encompassing 5,676 adults across the human lifespan. We discovered nearly 20% of the population show strongly accelerated age in one organ and 1.7% are multi-organ agers. Accelerated organ aging confers 20–50% higher mortality risk, and organ-specific diseases relate to faster aging of those organs. We find individuals with accelerated heart aging have a 250% increased heart failure risk and accelerated brain and vascular aging predict Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression independently from and as strongly as plasma pTau-181 (ref.\n              5\n              ), the current best blood-based biomarker for AD.

Here we developed a proteomic age clock in the UK Biobank (\n              n\n               = 45,441) using a proteomic platform comprising 2,897 plasma proteins and explored its utility to predict major disease morbidity and mortality in diverse populations. We identified 204 proteins that accurately predict chronological age (Pearson\n              r\n               = 0.94) and found that proteomic aging was associated with the incidence of 18 major chronic diseases (including diseases of the heart, liver, kidney and lung, diabetes, neurodegeneration and cancer), as well as with multimorbidity and all-cause mortality risk. Proteomic aging was also associated with age-related measures of biological, physical and cognitive function, including telomere length, frailty index and reaction time. Proteins contributing most substantially to the proteomic age clock are involved in numerous biological functions, including extracellular matrix interactions, immune response and inflammation, hormone regulation and reproduction, neuronal structure and function and development and differentiation. In a validation study involving biobanks in China (\n              n\n               = 3,977) and Finland (\n              n\n               = 1,990), the proteomic age clock showed similar age prediction accuracy (Pearson\n              r\n               = 0.92 and\n              r\n               = 0.94, respectively) compared to its performance in the UK Biobank.

Despite this growing burden, there are currently no cures, and treatment options remain limited due to disease heterogeneity, prolonged preclinical and prodromal phases, poor understanding of disease mechanisms, and diagnostic challenges. Identifying novel biomarkers is crucial for improving early detection, prognosis, staging and subtyping of these conditions. High-dimensional molecular studies in biofluids (‘omics’) offer promise for scalable biomarker discovery, but challenges in assembling large, diverse datasets hinder progress. To address this, the Global Neurodegeneration Proteomics Consortium (GNPC)—a public–private partnership—established one of the world’s largest harmonized proteomic datasets. It includes approximately 250 million unique protein measurements from multiple platforms from more than 35,000 biofluid samples (plasma, serum and cerebrospinal fluid) contributed by 23 partners, alongside associated clinical data spanning Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This dataset is accessible to GNPC members via the Alzheimer’s Disease Data Initiative’s AD Workbench, a secure cloud-based environment, and will be available to the wider research community on 15 July 2025. Here we present summary analyses of the plasma proteome revealing disease-specific differential protein abundance and transdiagnostic proteomic signatures of clinical severity. Furthermore, we describe a robust plasma proteomic signature of APOE ε4 carriership, reproducible across AD, PD, FTD and ALS, as well as distinct patterns of organ aging across these conditions. This work demonstrates the power of international collaboration, data sharing and open science to accelerate discovery in neurodegeneration research.","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03834-0","numberInSourceReferences":5},{"id":"ZVLYSWJY","doi":"10.1016/j.landig.2025.01.006","type":"journalArticle","title":"Proteomic organ-specific ageing signatures and 20-year risk of age-related diseases: the Whitehall II observational cohort study","authors":[{"LN":"Kivimäki","FN":"Mika"},{"LN":"Frank","FN":"Philipp"},{"LN":"Pentti","FN":"Jaana"},{"LN":"Jokela","FN":"Markus"},{"LN":"Nyberg","FN":"Solja T."},{"LN":"Blake","FN":"Acer"},{"LN":"Lindbohm","FN":"Joni V."},{"LN":"Oh","FN":"Hamilton Se-Hwee"},{"LN":"Singh-Manoux","FN":"Archana"},{"LN":"Wyss-Coray","FN":"Tony"},{"LN":"Partridge","FN":"Linda"}],"year":"2025","date":"2025-03-01","journal":"The Lancet Digital Health","volume":"7","issue":"3","firstPage":"e195","lastPage":"e204","references":["W88BHUV3","tmp29289","tmp11772","tmp35365","tmp29841","S59GBVR8","R3ZGVBLH","tmp68491","tmp15321","tmp91294","tmp65596","tmp08474","tmp08657","tmp42601","tmp11304","tmp94404","tmp28666","tmp36447","tmp40156","tmp88718","tmp88010","tmp32939","tmp98891","tmp46511","tmp76980","tmp28002","tmp32141","tmp65865","MDETEZFQ","tmp92642","tmp21408","tmp24474","tmp53790"],"abstract":"Background\nBiological ageing is known to vary among different organs within an individual, but the extent to which advanced ageing of specific organs increases the risk of age-related diseases in the same and other organs remains poorly understood.\nMethods\nIn this observational cohort study, to assess the biological age of an individual's organs relative to those of same-aged peers, ie, organ age gaps, we collected plasma samples from 6235 middle-aged (age 45–69 years) participants of the Whitehall II prospective cohort study in London, UK, in 1997–99. Age gaps of nine organs were determined from plasma proteins via SomaScan (SomaLogic; Boulder, CO, USA) using the Python package organage.

Six diseases were exclusively associated with accelerated ageing of their respective organ: liver failure (hazard ratio [HR] per SD increment in the organ age gap 2·13 [95% CI 1·41–3·22]), dilated cardiomyopathy (HR 1·65 [1·28–2·12]), chronic heart failure (HR 1·52 [1·40–1·65]), lung cancer (HR 1·29 [1·04–1·59]), agranulocytosis (HR 1·27 [1·07–1·51]), and lymphatic node metastasis (HR 1·23 [1·06–1·43]). 24 diseases were associated with more than one organ age gap or with organ age gaps not directly related to the disease location. Larger age gaps were also associated with elevated HRs of developing two or more diseases affecting different organs within the same individual (ie, multiorgan multimorbidity): 2·03 (1·51–2·74) for the arterial age gap, 1·78 (1·48–2·14) for the kidney age gap, 1·52 (1·38–1·68) for the heart age gap, 1·52 (1·12–2·06) for the brain age gap, 1·43 (1·16–1·78) for the pancreas age gap, 1·37 (1·17–1·61) for the lung age gap, 1·36 (1·26–1·46) for the immune system age gap, and 1·30 (1·18–1·42) for the liver age gap.\nInterpretation\nAdvanced proteomic organ ageing is associated with the long-term risk of age-related diseases. In most cases, faster ageing of a specific organ increases susceptibility to morbidity affecting multiple organs.","url":"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(25)00006-8/fulltext","numberInSourceReferences":4},{"id":"AWDLP86H","doi":"10.1101/2025.09.07.25335188","type":"preprint","title":"Eight decades of follow-up link life course exposures to proteomic organ ageing and longevity","authors":[{"LN":"Groves","FN":"James W."},{"LN":"Bot","FN":"Veronica Augustina"},{"LN":"Ding","FN":"Daisy Yi"},{"LN":"Nicholas","FN":"Jennifer"},{"LN":"Farinas","FN":"Amelia"},{"LN":"See-Oh","FN":"Hamilton"},{"LN":"James","FN":"Sarah-Naomi"},{"LN":"Wong","FN":"Andrew"},{"LN":"Williams","FN":"Dylan M."},{"LN":"King-Robson","FN":"Josh"},{"LN":"Chaturvedi","FN":"Nishi"},{"LN":"Richards","FN":"Marcus"},{"LN":"Wyss-Coray","FN":"Tony"},{"LN":"Schott","FN":"Jonathan M."}],"year":"2025","date":"2025-09-08","journal":"","volume":"","issue":"","firstPage":"","references":["W88BHUV3","ZHZWLF7S","JP98KKPT","R3ZGVBLH","tmp57564","tmp91549","tmp12490","7X2U7I6X","tmp48112","tmp50928","VVSQA7BH","tmp23852","tmp84910","tmp54601","tmp68931","tmp10990","tmp96672","tmp14676","tmp64503","tmp98970","tmp26023","tmp11161","tmp16472","tmp21145","tmp06397","tmp16848","YD264JC4","tmp86120","ZVLYSWJY","tmp53576","tmp73816","tmp69147","tmp95721","tmp01546","tmp91901","tmp10008","tmp44231","tmp21716","tmp11741","tmp38170","tmp74461","tmp27988","tmp29747","tmp48482","tmp83749","tmp58989","tmp22169","tmp66882","tmp18223"],"abstract":"The pace of organ ageing varies substantially between individuals, yet drivers of variability remain poorly understood.

Here, we leverage the unique design of the MRC National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD), the world’s oldest continuously followed birth cohort, to track 1,803 individuals across eight decades since birth in 1946. At mean age 63.2 years, we estimated proteomic ageing in seven organs. Despite near identical chronological ages, participants’ proteomes revealed biological ageing disparities spanning decades.

To address this gap, we estimate the biological age of 11 organs using plasma proteomics data (2,916 proteins) from 44,498 individuals in the UK Biobank. Organ age estimates were sensitive to lifestyle factors and medications and were associated with future onset (within 17 yearsʼ follow-up) of a range of diseases, including heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease. Notably, having an especially aged brain posed a risk of Alzheimer’s disease (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.1) that was similar to carrying one copy of APOE4, the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer’s disease, whereas a youthful brain (HR = 0.26) provided protection that was similar to carrying two copies of APOE2, independent of APOE genotype. Accrual of aged organs progressively increased mortality risk (2–4 aged organs, HR = 2.3; 5–7 aged organs, HR = 4.5; 8+ aged organs, HR = 8.3), whereas youthful brains and immune systems were uniquely associated with longevity (youthful brain, HR = 0.60 for mortality risk; youthful immune system, HR = 0.58; youthful both, HR = 0.44). Altogether, these findings support the use of plasma proteins for monitoring of organ health and point to the brain and immune systems as key targets for longevity interventions.","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03798-1","numberInSourceReferences":3},{"id":"ZHZWLF7S","doi":"10.1016/j.cmet.2024.10.005","type":"journalArticle","title":"Plasma protein-based organ-specific aging and mortality models unveil diseases as accelerated aging of organismal systems","authors":[{"LN":"Goeminne","FN":"Ludger J.

Accelerated organ aging leads to diseases in these organs, and specific diets, lifestyles, professions, and medications influence organ aging rates.

Here we used SomaScan proteomics to characterize paired CSF and plasma samples from 2,171 healthy or cognitively impaired older individuals from multiple cohorts, including the Global Neurodegeneration Proteomics Consortium. We identified proteins with correlated CSF and plasma levels that are produced primarily outside the brain and are enriched for structural domains that may enable their transport across brain barriers. CSF to plasma ratios of 848 proteins increased with aging in healthy control individuals, including complement and coagulation proteins, chemokines and proteins linked to neurodegeneration, whereas 64 protein ratios decreased with age, suggesting substrate-specific barrier regulation. Notably, elevated CSF to plasma ratios of peripherally derived or vascular-associated proteins, including DCUN1D1, MFGE8 and VEGFA, were associated with preserved cognitive function. Genome-wide association studies identified genetic loci associated with CSF to plasma ratios of 241 proteins, many of which have known disease associations, including FCN2, the collagen-like domain of which may facilitate blood–CSF transport.

Although biomarkers for amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau proteins, the hallmark AD pathologies, have improved pathology-based diagnosis, they explain only 20–40% of the variance in AD-related cognitive impairment (CI). To discover novel biomarkers of CI in AD, we performed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics on 3,397 individuals from six major prospective AD case–control cohorts. Synapse proteins emerged as the strongest correlates of CI, independent of Aβ and tau. Using machine learning, we derived the CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 synapse protein ratio, which explained 27% of the variance in CI beyond CSF pTau181:Aβ42, 11% beyond tau positron emission tomography, and 28% beyond CSF neurofilament, growth-associated protein 43 and neurogranin in Aβ+ and phosphorylated tau+ (A+T1+) individuals. CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 also increased with normal aging and 20 years before estimated symptom onset in carriers of autosomal dominant AD mutations. Regarding cognitive prognosis, CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 predicted conversion from A+T1+ cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment (standard deviation increase hazard ratio = 3.0, P = 7.0 × 10–4) and A+T1+ mild cognitive impairment to dementia (standard deviation increase hazard ratio = 2.2, P = 8.2 × 10–16) over a 15-year follow-up, adjusting for CSF pTau181:Aβ42, CSF neurofilament, CSF neurogranin, CSF growth-associated protein 43, age, APOE4 and sex. We also developed a plasma proteomic signature of CI, which we evaluated in 13,401 samples, which partly recapitulated CSF YWHAG:NPTX2. Overall, our findings underscore CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 as a robust prognostic biomarker for cognitive resilience versus AD onset and progression, highlight the potential of plasma proteomics in replacing CSF measurement and further implicate synapse dysfunction as a core driver of AD dementia.","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03565-2","numberInSourceReferences":2},{"id":"HAHVYMGV","doi":"10.1016/j.neuron.2025.02.014","type":"journalArticle","title":"Multi-cohort cerebrospinal fluid proteomics identifies robust molecular signatures across the Alzheimer disease continuum","authors":[{"LN":"Ali","FN":"Muhammad"},{"LN":"Timsina","FN":"Jigyasha"},{"LN":"Western","FN":"Daniel"},{"LN":"Liu","FN":"Menghan"},{"LN":"Beric","FN":"Aleksandra"},{"LN":"Budde","FN":"John"},{"LN":"Do","FN":"Anh"},{"LN":"Heo","FN":"Gyujin"},{"LN":"Wang","FN":"Lihua"},{"LN":"Gentsch","FN":"Jen"},{"LN":"Schindler","FN":"Suzanne E."},{"LN":"Morris","FN":"John C."},{"LN":"Holtzman","FN":"David M."},{"LN":"Ruiz","FN":"Agustin"},{"LN":"Alvarez","FN":"Ignacio"},{"LN":"Aguilar","FN":"Miquel"},{"LN":"Pastor","FN":"Pau"},{"LN":"Rutledge","FN":"Jarod"},{"LN":"Oh","FN":"Hamilton"},{"LN":"Wilson","FN":"Edward N."},{"LN":"Guen","FN":"Yann Le"},{"LN":"Khalid","FN":"Rana R."},{"LN":"Robins","FN":"Chloe"},{"LN":"Pulford","FN":"David J."},{"LN":"Tarawneh","FN":"Rawan"},{"LN":"Ibanez","FN":"Laura"},{"LN":"Wyss-Coray","FN":"Tony"},{"LN":"Sung","FN":"Yun Ju"},{"LN":"Cruchaga","FN":"Carlos"}],"year":"2025","date":"2025-05-07","journal":"Neuron","volume":"113","issue":"9","firstPage":"1363","lastPage":"1379.e9","references":["J5XCQ6KJ","SPF89DRI","tmp29416","tmp84652","tmp55994","tmp29289","tmp00977","tmp61696","tmp98353","tmp21808","tmp80033","tmp61682","tmp95271","tmp62394","tmp88525","tmp17523","tmp19068","tmp86565","tmp65990","tmp64037","tmp74671","tmp85690","tmp45485","tmp89497","tmp03142","tmp72888","tmp36523","RNSC65TU","tmp97423","tmp93221","tmp32090","tmp42030","tmp39805","tmp29653","tmp54302","tmp29193","tmp88612","tmp31137","tmp54431","tmp40639","tmp20747","tmp30822","tmp00595","tmp71009","tmp44001","tmp43344","tmp33586","tmp27896","tmp41860","tmp58700","tmp79617","tmp67803","tmp74925","tmp18452","tmp26413","tmp21344","tmp16926","tmp62327","tmp75511","tmp23859","tmp23273","tmp44056","tmp13619","tmp89572","tmp68349","tmp44324","tmp07999","tmp33132","tmp12467","tmp29196","tmp37100","tmp76092","tmp39101","tmp74709","tmp80028","tmp85316","tmp93055","tmp90778","tmp95468","tmp44813","tmp28140","tmp38391","tmp58070","tmp87363","tmp80734","tmp64367","tmp36128","tmp29542","tmp37572","tmp27397","tmp91141","tmp77652","tmp69839","tmp79114","tmp88769","tmp67527","tmp21780","tmp15436","tmp20300","tmp73809","tmp17591","tmp99938","tmp20473","tmp00814","tmp87555","tmp02799","tmp60984","tmp01583","tmp37538","tmp05074","tmp67922","tmp53082","tmp02498","tmp40360","tmp10815","tmp98344","tmp39313","tmp31045","tmp83192","tmp68787","tmp63483","tmp33753","tmp99859","tmp69284","tmp14947","tmp53007","tmp00187","tmp77147","tmp49026","tmp51906","tmp94616","tmp03444","tmp37101","tmp08092","tmp13031","tmp81412","tmp89788","tmp87645","tmp96723","tmp35813","tmp22599","tmp46315","tmp09034","tmp43889","tmp78235","tmp16136","tmp80296","tmp78695","tmp55102"],"abstract":"Previous article\nNext article\nHighlights\n•\nLarge-scale CSF proteomics identified more than 2,000 associated with AD\n•\nProteomic changes in the AD continuum follow four distinct pseudo-trajectories\n•\nIndividuals positive for the 10-protein panel display higher probability of developing AD\n•\n10-protein AD model predicts the progression to symptomatic AD\nSummary\nChanges in β-amyloid (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau (T) in brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) precede Alzheimer’s disease (AD) symptoms, making the CSF proteome a potential avenue to understand disease pathophysiology and facilitate reliable diagnostics and therapies.

Using machine learning, we created and validated highly accurate and replicable (area under the curve [AUC] > 0.90) models that predict AD biomarker positivity and clinical status. These models can also identify people that will convert to AD.","url":"https://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(25)00132-1","numberInSourceReferences":9},{"id":"JE83VMU6","doi":"10.1038/s41467-025-68101-9","type":"journalArticle","title":"Acute exercise rewires the proteomic landscape of human immune cells","authors":[{"LN":"Walzik","FN":"David"},{"LN":"Joisten","FN":"Niklas"},{"LN":"Metcalfe","FN":"Alan J."},{"LN":"Proschinger","FN":"Sebastian"},{"LN":"Schenk","FN":"Alexander"},{"LN":"Wenzel","FN":"Charlotte"},{"LN":"Henneberg","FN":"Alessa L."},{"LN":"Schneider","FN":"Martin"},{"LN":"Calderazzo","FN":"Silvia"},{"LN":"Groll","FN":"Andreas"},{"LN":"Watzl","FN":"Carsten"},{"LN":"Opitz","FN":"Christiane A."},{"LN":"Helm","FN":"Dominic"},{"LN":"Zimmer","FN":"Philipp"}],"year":"2026","date":"2026-01-02","journal":"Nature Communications","volume":"17","issue":"1","firstPage":"130","references":["tmp63753","tmp43837","tmp96676","tmp99862","tmp30236","tmp22967","tmp80979","tmp56575","tmp69406","tmp89762","tmp78034","tmp01313","tmp22216","tmp62435","tmp18123","tmp18570","tmp54556","tmp35858","tmp97034","tmp63274","tmp27510","tmp03475","tmp51954","tmp95518","tmp03480","tmp00558","tmp50313","tmp71430","GT3K5UP7","tmp88166","tmp14320","tmp18399","tmp55393","tmp46223","tmp50000","tmp50290","tmp17877","tmp45888","tmp25860","tmp74954","tmp37689","tmp27346","tmp53688","tmp13450","tmp06053","tmp91651","tmp29378","tmp66886","tmp22734","tmp82597","tmp00499","tmp35190","tmp59501","tmp90899","tmp63501","tmp36470","tmp19536","tmp66120","tmp15107","tmp05400","tmp38717","tmp74491","tmp35692","tmp27298","tmp84791","tmp45401","J5XCQ6KJ","tmp16492","tmp66090","RSFIL9WQ","IRIURUIS","SPF89DRI","tmp59711","tmp41296","tmp53416"],"abstract":"The positive effect of exercise on the immune system is widely acknowledged, but the molecular response of immune cells to exercise remains largely unknown. Here, we perform mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analysis on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) at a depth of >6000 proteins. Comparing high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) and moderate-intensity continuous exercise (MICE), matched for time and workload, we identify versatile changes in the proteomic makeup of PBMCs and reveal profound alterations, related to effector function and immune cell activation pathways within one hour following exercise. These changes are more pronounced after HIIE compared to MICE and occur despite identical immune cell mobilization patterns between the two exercise conditions. We further identify an immunoproteomic signature that effectively predicts cardiorespiratory fitness, thus allowing insights into potential exercise-triggered adaptations and immunological health benefits that are mediated by exercise. This study provides a reliable data resource that expands our knowledge on how exercise modulates the immune system, and delivers biological evidence supporting the WHO 2020 guidelines, which highlight exercise intensity as a relevant factor to maintain health.","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-68101-9","numberInSourceReferences":1}],"citedArticles":[{"id":"tmp78235","doi":"10.1002/j.1538-7305.1957.tb01515.x","type":"journalArticle","title":"Shortest Connection Networks And Some Generalizations","authors":[{"LN":"Prim","FN":"R.

This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses — the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.","url":"https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2517-6161.1995.tb02031.x","numberInSourceReferences":3},{"id":"tmp09034","doi":"10.1142/S0218339095000381","type":"journalArticle","title":"Feedback Loops, Stability and Multistationarity in Dynamical Systems","authors":[{"LN":"Plahte","FN":"Erik"},{"LN":"Mestl","FN":"Thomas"},{"LN":"Omholt","FN":"Stig W."}],"year":"1995","date":"1995-06-01","journal":"Journal of Biological Systems","volume":"03","issue":"02","firstPage":"409","lastPage":"413","references":[],"abstract":"","url":"https://doi.org/10.1142/S0218339095000381","numberInSourceReferences":664},{"id":"tmp57564","doi":"10.1007/BF02185763","type":"journalArticle","title":"The heritability of human longevity: A population-based study of 2872 Danish twin pairs born 1870–1900","authors":[{"LN":"Herskind","FN":"Anne Maria"},{"LN":"McGue","FN":"Matthew"},{"LN":"Holm","FN":"Niels V."},{"LN":"Sørensen","FN":"Thorkild I.

Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.","url":"https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2517-6161.1996.tb02080.x","numberInSourceReferences":533},{"id":"tmp68787","doi":"10.1074/jbc.271.5.2724","type":"journalArticle","title":"The Three Human Syntrophin Genes Are Expressed in Diverse Tissues, Have Distinct Chromosomal Locations, and Each Bind to Dystrophin and Its Relatives","authors":[{"LN":"Ahn","FN":"Andrew H."},{"LN":"Freener","FN":"Chris A."},{"LN":"Gussoni","FN":"Emanuela"},{"LN":"Yoshida","FN":"Mikiharu"},{"LN":"Ozawa","FN":"Eijiro"},{"LN":"Kunkel","FN":"Louis M."}],"year":"1996","date":"1996-02-01","journal":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","volume":"271","issue":"5","firstPage":"2724","lastPage":"2730","references":[],"abstract":"","url":"https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.271.5.2724","numberInSourceReferences":642},{"id":"tmp23859","doi":"10.1016/S0304-3940(97)00797-0","type":"journalArticle","title":"Alteration of transcription factors NF-κB and STAT1 in Alzheimer's disease brains","authors":[{"LN":"Kitamura","FN":"Yoshihisa"},{"LN":"Shimohama","FN":"Shun"},{"LN":"Ota","FN":"Takashi"},{"LN":"Matsuoka","FN":"Yasuji"},{"LN":"Nomura","FN":"Yasuyuki"},{"LN":"Taniguchi","FN":"Takashi"}],"year":"1997","date":"1997-11-01","journal":"Neuroscience Letters","volume":"237","issue":"1","firstPage":"17","lastPage":"20","references":[],"abstract":"","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3940(97)00797-0","numberInSourceReferences":582},{"id":"tmp72271","doi":"10.1001/archneur.55.3.326","type":"journalArticle","title":"Clinicopathologic Studies in Cognitively Healthy Aging and Alzheimer Disease","authors":[{"LN":"Berg","FN":"Leonard"},{"LN":"McKeel","FN":"Daniel W."},{"LN":"Miller","FN":"J.

extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.","url":"https://www.pnas.org/content/102/43/15545","numberInSourceReferences":2},{"id":"tmp45616","doi":"10.1038/nature03260","type":"journalArticle","title":"Rejuvenation of aged progenitor cells by exposure to a young systemic environment","authors":[{"LN":"Conboy","FN":"Irina M."},{"LN":"Conboy","FN":"Michael J."},{"LN":"Wagers","FN":"Amy J."},{"LN":"Girma","FN":"Eric R."},{"LN":"Weissman","FN":"Irving L."},{"LN":"Rando","FN":"Thomas A."}],"year":"2005","date":"2005-02-01","journal":"Nature","volume":"433","issue":"7027","firstPage":"760","lastPage":"764","references":[],"abstract":"","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature03260","numberInSourceReferences":12},{"id":"tmp86683","doi":"10.1093/ije/dyi174","type":"journalArticle","title":"Cohort Profile: The Kadoorie Study of Chronic Disease in China (KSCDC)","authors":[{"LN":"Chen","FN":"Zhengming"},{"LN":"Lee","FN":"Liming"},{"LN":"Chen","FN":"Junshi"},{"LN":"Collins","FN":"Rory"},{"LN":"Wu","FN":"Fan"},{"LN":"Yu","FN":"Canqing"},{"LN":"Linksted","FN":"Pamela"},{"LN":"Peto","FN":"Richard"}],"year":"2005","date":"2005-08-30","journal":"International Journal of Epidemiology","volume":"34","issue":"6","firstPage":"1243","lastPage":"1249","references":[],"abstract":"","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyi174","numberInSourceReferences":216},{"id":"tmp10990","doi":"10.1093/ije/dyi201","type":"journalArticle","title":"Cohort Profile: The 1946 National Birth Cohort (MRC National Survey of Health and Development)","authors":[{"LN":"Wadsworth","FN":"Michael"},{"LN":"Kuh","FN":"Diana"},{"LN":"Richards","FN":"Marcus"},{"LN":"Hardy","FN":"Rebecca"}],"year":"2005","date":"2005-10-04","journal":"International Journal of Epidemiology","volume":"35","issue":"1","firstPage":"49","lastPage":"54","references":[],"abstract":"","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyi201","numberInSourceReferences":274},{"id":"tmp29747","doi":"10.1056/NEJMoa041152","type":"journalArticle","title":"Effects of Moderate Alcohol Consumption on Cognitive Function in Women","authors":[{"LN":"Stampfer","FN":"Meir J."},{"LN":"Kang","FN":"Jae H."},{"LN":"Chen","FN":"Jennifer"},{"LN":"Cherry","FN":"Rebecca N."},{"LN":"Grodstein","FN":"Francine"}],"year":"2005","date":"2005-01-19","journal":"New England Journal of Medicine","volume":"352","issue":"3","firstPage":"245","lastPage":"253","references":[],"abstract":"","url":"https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa041152","numberInSourceReferences":300},{"id":"tmp98556","doi":"10.1038/nm1233","type":"journalArticle","title":"Lactadherin promotes VEGF-dependent neovascularization","authors":[{"LN":"Silvestre","FN":"Jean-Sébastien"},{"LN":"Théry","FN":"Clotilde"},{"LN":"Hamard","FN":"Ghislaine"},{"LN":"Boddaert","FN":"Jacques"},{"LN":"Aguilar","FN":"Barbara"},{"LN":"Delcayre","FN":"Alain"},{"LN":"Houbron","FN":"Christophe"},{"LN":"Tamarat","FN":"Radia"},{"LN":"Blanc‐Brude","FN":"Olivier"},{"LN":"Heeneman","FN":"Sylvia"},{"LN":"Clergue","FN":"Michel"},{"LN":"Duriez","FN":"Micheline"},{"LN":"Merval","FN":"Régine"},{"LN":"Lévy","FN":"Bernard"},{"LN":"Tedgui","FN":"Alain"},{"LN":"Amigorena","FN":"Sebastián"},{"LN":"Mallat","FN":"Ziad"}],"year":"2005","date":"2005-04-17","journal":"Nature Medicine","volume":"11","issue":"5","firstPage":"499","lastPage":"506","references":[],"abstract":"","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/nm1233","numberInSourceReferences":438},{"id":"tmp44324","doi":"10.1385/JMN:25:1:079","type":"journalArticle","title":"Phospho-β-Catenin Accumulation in Alzheimer's Disease and in Aggresomes Attributable to Proteasome Dysfunction","authors":[{"LN":"Ghanevati","FN":"Mahin"},{"LN":"Miller","FN":"Carol A."}],"year":"2005","date":"2005-01-01","journal":"Journal of Molecular Neuroscience","volume":"25","issue":"1","firstPage":"079","lastPage":"094","references":[],"abstract":"","url":"https://doi.org/10.1385/JMN:25:1:079","numberInSourceReferences":588},{"id":"tmp63753","doi":"10.1097/00001504-200503000-00013","type":"journalArticle","title":"Exercise and well-being: a review of mental and physical health benefits associated with physical activity","authors":[{"LN":"Penedo","FN":"Frank J."},{"LN":"Dahn","FN":"Jason R."}],"year":"2005","date":"2005-02-04","journal":"Current Opinion in Psychiatry","volume":"18","issue":"2","firstPage":"189","lastPage":"193","references":[],"abstract":"","url":"https://doi.org/10.1097/00001504-200503000-00013","numberInSourceReferences":671},{"id":"tmp51954","doi":"10.1038/ni1242","type":"journalArticle","title":"Negative regulation of natural killer cell function by EAT-2, a SAP-related adaptor","authors":[{"LN":"Roncagalli","FN":"Romain"},{"LN":"Taylor","FN":"James E.

These hallmarks are interconnected among each other, as well as to the recently proposed hallmarks of health, which include organizational features of spatial compartmentalization, maintenance of homeostasis, and adequate responses to stress.","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867413006454","numberInSourceReferences":245},{"id":"tmp60456","doi":"10.1038/ng.2653","type":"journalArticle","title":"The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project","authors":[{"LN":"Lonsdale","FN":"John T."},{"LN":"Thomas","FN":"Jeffrey A."},{"LN":"Salvatore","FN":"Mike"},{"LN":"Phillips","FN":"Rebecca"},{"LN":"Lo","FN":"Edmund"},{"LN":"Shad","FN":"Saboor"},{"LN":"Hasz","FN":"Richard"},{"LN":"Walters","FN":"Gary"},{"LN":"Garcia","FN":"Fernando U."},{"LN":"Young","FN":"Nancy"},{"LN":"Foster","FN":"Barbara A."},{"LN":"Moser","FN":"Mike"},{"LN":"Karasik","FN":"Ellen"},{"LN":"Gillard","FN":"Bryan M."},{"LN":"Ramsey","FN":"Kimberley D."},{"LN":"Sullivan","FN":"Susan"},{"LN":"Bridge","FN":"Jason"},{"LN":"Magazine","FN":"Harold I."},{"LN":"Syron","FN":"John"},{"LN":"Fleming","FN":"Johnelle"},{"LN":"Siminoff","FN":"Laura A."},{"LN":"Traino","FN":"Heather M."},{"LN":"Mosavel","FN":"Maghboeba"},{"LN":"Barker","FN":"Laura K."},{"LN":"Jewell","FN":"Scott D."},{"LN":"Rohrer","FN":"Dan"},{"LN":"Maxim","FN":"Dan"},{"LN":"Filkins","FN":"Dana"},{"LN":"Harbach","FN":"P.

However, ageing does not affect people uniformly. Hence, markers of the underlying biological ageing process are needed to help identify people at increased risk of age-associated physical and cognitive impairments and ultimately, death. Here, we present such a biomarker, ‘brain-predicted age’, derived using structural neuroimaging. Brain-predicted age was calculated using machine-learning analysis, trained on neuroimaging data from a large healthy reference sample (N=2001), then tested in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (N=669), to determine relationships with age-associated functional measures and mortality. Having a brain-predicted age indicative of an older-appearing brain was associated with: weaker grip strength, poorer lung function, slower walking speed, lower fluid intelligence, higher allostatic load and increased mortality risk. Furthermore, while combining brain-predicted age with grey matter and cerebrospinal fluid volumes (themselves strong predictors) not did improve mortality risk prediction, the combination of brain-predicted age and DNA-methylation-predicted age did. This indicates that neuroimaging and epigenetics measures of ageing can provide complementary data regarding health outcomes. Our study introduces a clinically-relevant neuroimaging ageing biomarker and demonstrates that combining distinct measurements of biological ageing further helps to determine risk of age-related deterioration and death.","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/mp201762","numberInSourceReferences":134},{"id":"3MZKN6DC","doi":"10.18632/aging.101414","type":"journalArticle","title":"An epigenetic biomarker of aging for lifespan and healthspan","authors":[{"LN":"Levine","FN":"Morgan E."},{"LN":"Lu","FN":"Ake T."},{"LN":"Quach","FN":"Austin"},{"LN":"Chen","FN":"Brian H."},{"LN":"Assimes","FN":"Themistocles L."},{"LN":"Bandinelli","FN":"Stefania"},{"LN":"Hou","FN":"Lifang"},{"LN":"Baccarelli","FN":"Andrea A."},{"LN":"Stewart","FN":"James D."},{"LN":"Li","FN":"Yun"},{"LN":"Whitsel","FN":"Eric A."},{"LN":"Wilson","FN":"James G"},{"LN":"Reiner","FN":"Alex P"},{"LN":"Aviv","FN":"Abraham"},{"LN":"Lohman","FN":"Kurt"},{"LN":"Liu","FN":"Yongmei"},{"LN":"Ferrucci","FN":"Luigi"},{"LN":"Horvath","FN":"Steve"}],"year":"2018","date":"2018-04-18","journal":"Aging","volume":"10","issue":"4","firstPage":"573","lastPage":"591","references":[],"abstract":"Identifying reliable biomarkers of aging is a major goal in geroscience. While the first generation of epigenetic biomarkers of aging were developed using chronological age as a surrogate for biological age, we hypothesized that incorporation of composite clinical measures of phenotypic age that capture differences in lifespan and healthspan may identify novel CpGs and facilitate the development of a more powerful epigenetic biomarker of aging. Using an innovative two-step process, we develop a new epigenetic biomarker of aging, DNAm PhenoAge, that strongly outperforms previous measures in regards to predictions for a variety of aging outcomes, including all-cause mortality, cancers, healthspan, physical functioning, and Alzheimer's disease. While this biomarker was developed using data from whole blood, it correlates strongly with age in every tissue and cell tested. Based on an in-depth transcriptional analysis in sorted cells, we find that increased epigenetic, relative to chronological age, is associated with increased activation of pro-inflammatory and interferon pathways, and decreased activation of transcriptional/translational machinery, DNA damage response, and mitochondrial signatures. Overall, this single epigenetic biomarker of aging is able to capture risks for an array of diverse outcomes across multiple tissues and cells, and provide insight into important pathways in aging.","url":"https://www.aging-us.com/lookup/doi/10.18632/aging.101414","numberInSourceReferences":135},{"id":"tmp26498","doi":"10.1016/j.pmedr.2018.10.008","type":"journalArticle","title":"The global burden of multiple chronic conditions: A narrative review","authors":[{"LN":"Hajat","FN":"Cother"},{"LN":"Stein","FN":"Emma"}],"year":"2018","date":"2018-10-20","journal":"Preventive Medicine Reports","volume":"12","issue":"","firstPage":"284","lastPage":"293","references":[],"abstract":"","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2018.10.008","numberInSourceReferences":144},{"id":"tmp58038","doi":"10.1161/JAHA.117.008108","type":"journalArticle","title":"Protein Biomarkers of Cardiovascular Disease and Mortality in the Community","authors":[{"LN":"Ho","FN":"Jennifer E."},{"LN":"Lyass","FN":"Asya"},{"LN":"Courchesne","FN":"Paul"},{"LN":"Chen","FN":"George"},{"LN":"Liu","FN":"Chunyu"},{"LN":"Yin","FN":"Xiaoyan"},{"LN":"Hwang","FN":"Shih-Jen"},{"LN":"Massaro","FN":"Joseph M."},{"LN":"Larson","FN":"Martin G."},{"LN":"Levy","FN":"Daniel"}],"year":"2018","date":"2018-07-13","journal":"Journal of the American Heart Association","volume":"7","issue":"14","firstPage":"","references":[],"abstract":"","url":"https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.117.008108","numberInSourceReferences":153},{"id":"tmp45833","doi":"10.1038/s41586-018-0457-8","type":"journalArticle","title":"Facing up to the global challenges of ageing","authors":[{"LN":"Partridge","FN":"Linda"},{"LN":"Deelen","FN":"Joris"},{"LN":"Slagboom","FN":"P.

Mechanisms of aging are thus increasingly recognized as potential therapeutic targets. Blood from young mice reverses aspects of aging and disease across multiple tissues2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, which supports a hypothesis that age-related molecular changes in blood could provide new insights into age-related disease biology. We measured 2,925 plasma proteins from 4,263 young adults to nonagenarians (18–95 years old) and developed a new bioinformatics approach that uncovered marked non-linear alterations in the human plasma proteome with age. Waves of changes in the proteome in the fourth, seventh and eighth decades of life reflected distinct biological pathways and revealed differential associations with the genome and proteome of age-related diseases and phenotypic traits. This new approach to the study of aging led to the identification of unexpected signatures and pathways that might offer potential targets for age-related diseases.","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0673-2","numberInSourceReferences":13},{"id":"tmp36447","doi":"10.1126/science.aaz1776","type":"journalArticle","title":"The GTEx

Efforts to tackle age-related diseases and increase healthspan have suggested targeting the ageing process itself to ‘rejuvenate’ physiological functioning.

Spurred by recent advances in high-throughput omics technologies, a new generation of tools to measure biological ageing now enables the quantitative characterization of ageing at molecular resolution. Epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic data can be harnessed with machine learning to build ‘ageing clocks’ with demonstrated capacity to identify new biomarkers of biological ageing.","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-022-00511-7","numberInSourceReferences":131},{"id":"tmp56778","doi":"10.1038/s41586-021-04369-3","type":"journalArticle","title":"A human brain vascular atlas reveals diverse mediators of Alzheimer’s risk","authors":[{"LN":"Yang","FN":"Andrew C."},{"LN":"Vest","FN":"Ryan T."},{"LN":"Kern","FN":"Fabian"},{"LN":"Lee","FN":"Davis P."},{"LN":"Agam","FN":"Maayan"},{"LN":"Maat","FN":"Christina A."},{"LN":"Losada","FN":"Patricia Morán"},{"LN":"Chen","FN":"Michelle B."},{"LN":"Schaum","FN":"Nicholas"},{"LN":"Khoury","FN":"Nathalie"},{"LN":"Toland","FN":"Angus"},{"LN":"Calcuttawala","FN":"Kruti"},{"LN":"Shin","FN":"Heather"},{"LN":"Pálovics","FN":"Róbert"},{"LN":"Shin","FN":"Andrew"},{"LN":"Wang","FN":"Elizabeth"},{"LN":"Luo","FN":"Jian"},{"LN":"Gate","FN":"David"},{"LN":"Schulz‐Schaeffer","FN":"Walter"},{"LN":"Chu","FN":"Pauline"},{"LN":"Siegenthaler","FN":"Julie A."},{"LN":"McNerney","FN":"M.

Biomarkers of aging are critically important tools in achieving these objectives over realistic time frames. However, the current lack of standards and consensus on the properties of a reliable aging biomarker hinders their further development and validation for clinical applications. Here, we advance a framework for the terminology and characterization of biomarkers of aging, including classification and potential clinical use cases. We discuss validation steps and highlight ongoing challenges as potential areas in need of future research. This framework sets the stage for the development of valid biomarkers of aging and their ultimate utilization in clinical trials and practice.","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867423008577","numberInSourceReferences":244},{"id":"MDETEZFQ","doi":"10.1016/j.neuron.2022.12.029","type":"journalArticle","title":"Virus exposure and neurodegenerative disease risk across national biobanks","authors":[{"LN":"Levine","FN":"Kristin S."},{"LN":"Leonard","FN":"Hampton L."},{"LN":"Blauwendraat","FN":"Cornelis"},{"LN":"Iwaki","FN":"Hirotaka"},{"LN":"Johnson","FN":"Nicholas"},{"LN":"Bandres-Ciga","FN":"Sara"},{"LN":"Ferrucci","FN":"Luigi"},{"LN":"Faghri","FN":"Faraz"},{"LN":"Singleton","FN":"Andrew B."},{"LN":"Nalls","FN":"Mike A."}],"year":"2023","date":"1/2023","journal":"Neuron","volume":"","issue":"","firstPage":"S0896627322011473","references":[],"abstract":"Highlights\n\n    •\n    Identified 45 pairs of viral exposures associated with increased risk of NDDs\n    •\n    Replicated 22 of the viral exposures/NDD pairings\n    •\n    Replicated the previously reported Epstein-Barr and multiple sclerosis association\n    •\n    Follow-up shows significantly elevated risk of NDD years after viral exposure\n\nSummary\nWith recent findings connecting the Epstein-Barr virus to an increased risk of multiple sclerosis and growing concerns regarding the neurological impact of the coronavirus pandemic, we examined potential links between viral exposures and neurodegenerative disease risk. Using time series data from FinnGen for discovery and cross-sectional data from the UK Biobank for replication, we identified 45 viral exposures significantly associated with increased risk of neurodegenerative disease and replicated 22 of these associations. The largest effect association was between viral encephalitis exposure and Alzheimer’s disease. Influenza with pneumonia was significantly associated with five of the six neurodegenerative diseases studied. We also replicated the Epstein-Barr/multiple sclerosis association. Some of these exposures were associated with an increased risk of neurodegeneration up to 15 years after infection. As vaccines are currently available for some of the associated viruses, vaccination may be a way to reduce some risk of neurodegenerative disease.","url":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0896627322011473","numberInSourceReferences":261},{"id":"tmp53790","doi":"10.1126/scitranslmed.adf5681","type":"journalArticle","title":"Proteomics

Here we provide a detailed summary of this initiative, including technical and biological validations, insights into proteomic disease signatures, and prediction modelling for various demographic and health indicators. We present comprehensive protein quantitative trait locus (pQTL) mapping of 2,923 proteins that identifies 14,287 primary genetic associations, of which 81% are previously undescribed, alongside ancestry-specific pQTL mapping in non-European individuals. The study provides an updated characterization of the genetic architecture of the plasma proteome, contextualized with projected pQTL discovery rates as sample sizes and proteomic assay coverages increase over time. We offer extensive insights into trans pQTLs across multiple biological domains, highlight genetic influences on ligand–receptor interactions and pathway perturbations across a diverse collection of cytokines and complement networks, and illustrate long-range epistatic effects of ABO blood group and FUT2 secretor status on proteins with gastrointestinal tissue-enriched expression. We demonstrate the utility of these data for drug discovery by extending the genetic proxied effects of protein targets, such as PCSK9, on additional endpoints, and disentangle specific genes and proteins perturbed at loci associated with COVID-19 susceptibility. This public–private partnership provides the scientific community with an open-access proteomics resource of considerable breadth and depth to help to elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying proteo-genomic discoveries and accelerate the development of biomarkers, predictive models and therapeutics1.","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06592-6","numberInSourceReferences":11},{"id":"W88BHUV3","doi":"10.1038/s41586-023-06802-1","type":"journalArticle","title":"Organ aging signatures in the plasma proteome track health and disease","authors":[{"LN":"Oh","FN":"Hamilton Se-Hwee"},{"LN":"Rutledge","FN":"Jarod"},{"LN":"Nachun","FN":"Daniel"},{"LN":"Pálovics","FN":"Róbert"},{"LN":"Abiose","FN":"Olamide"},{"LN":"Moran-Losada","FN":"Patricia"},{"LN":"Channappa","FN":"Divya"},{"LN":"Urey","FN":"Deniz Yagmur"},{"LN":"Kim","FN":"Kate"},{"LN":"Sung","FN":"Yun Ju"},{"LN":"Wang","FN":"Lihua"},{"LN":"Timsina","FN":"Jigyasha"},{"LN":"Western","FN":"Dan"},{"LN":"Liu","FN":"Menghan"},{"LN":"Kohlfeld","FN":"Pat"},{"LN":"Budde","FN":"John"},{"LN":"Wilson","FN":"Edward N."},{"LN":"Guen","FN":"Yann"},{"LN":"Maurer","FN":"Taylor M."},{"LN":"Haney","FN":"Michael"},{"LN":"Yang","FN":"Andrew C."},{"LN":"He","FN":"Zihuai"},{"LN":"Greicius","FN":"Michael D."},{"LN":"Andreasson","FN":"Katrin I."},{"LN":"Sathyan","FN":"Sanish"},{"LN":"Weiss","FN":"Erica F."},{"LN":"Milman","FN":"Sofiya"},{"LN":"Barzilai","FN":"Nir"},{"LN":"Cruchaga","FN":"Carlos"},{"LN":"Wagner","FN":"Anthony D."},{"LN":"Mormino","FN":"Elizabeth"},{"LN":"Lehallier","FN":"Benoit"},{"LN":"Henderson","FN":"Victor W."},{"LN":"Longo","FN":"Frank M."},{"LN":"Montgomery","FN":"Stephen B."},{"LN":"Wyss-Coray","FN":"Tony"}],"year":"2023","date":"2023-12-07","journal":"Nature","volume":"624","issue":"7990","firstPage":"164","lastPage":"172","references":["tmp41296","tmp23608","tmp22887","tmp29289","tmp19051","tmp48689","tmp00067","tmp35365","tmp29841","tmp68491","tmp15321","tmp42601","tmp36447","tmp40156","7X2U7I6X","tmp50928","VVSQA7BH","tmp23852","YD264JC4","3MZKN6DC","tmp14161","tmp53589","tmp56778","tmp38168","IXIVR3HY","tmp85690","tmp39805","tmp48304","tmp49852","tmp17911","tmp26498","tmp45616","tmp67971","tmp87060","tmp41705","tmp82001","tmp22259","tmp70276","tmp20530","tmp35945","tmp58038","tmp98903","tmp00975","tmp20405","tmp51743","tmp11507","tmp50705","tmp95435","tmp73602","tmp56710","tmp01700","tmp35392","tmp25753","tmp90017","tmp66810","tmp55146","tmp72098","tmp89436","tmp88726","tmp81559","tmp84784","tmp57129","tmp21900","tmp95287","tmp72271","tmp52028","tmp40435","tmp56011","tmp55444","tmp84109","tmp32828"],"abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Animal studies show aging varies between individuals as well as between organs within an individual\n              1–4\n              , but whether this is true in humans and its effect on age-related diseases is unknown. We utilized levels of human blood plasma proteins originating from specific organs to measure organ-specific aging differences in living individuals. Using machine learning models, we analysed aging in 11 major organs and estimated organ age reproducibly in five independent cohorts encompassing 5,676 adults across the human lifespan. We discovered nearly 20% of the population show strongly accelerated age in one organ and 1.7% are multi-organ agers. Accelerated organ aging confers 20–50% higher mortality risk, and organ-specific diseases relate to faster aging of those organs. We find individuals with accelerated heart aging have a 250% increased heart failure risk and accelerated brain and vascular aging predict Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression independently from and as strongly as plasma pTau-181 (ref.\n              5\n              ), the current best blood-based biomarker for AD. Our models link vascular calcification, extracellular matrix alterations and synaptic protein shedding to early cognitive decline.

We leveraged multimodal brain imaging data from 10,949 healthy adults to estimate brain age gap (BAG), an indicator of brain aging. Proteome-wide association analysis across 4,696 participants of 2,922 proteins identified 13 significantly associated with BAG, implicating stress, regeneration and inflammation. Brevican (BCAN) (β = −0.838, P = 2.63 × 10−10) and growth differentiation factor 15 (β = 0.825, P = 3.48 × 10−11) showed the most significant, and multiple, associations with dementia, stroke and movement functions. Dysregulation of BCAN affected multiple cortical and subcortical structures. Mendelian randomization supported the causal association between BCAN and BAG. We revealed undulating changes in the plasma proteome across brain aging, and profiled brain age-related change peaks at 57, 70 and 78 years, implicating distinct biological pathways during brain aging. Our findings revealed the plasma proteomic landscape of brain aging and pinpointed biomarkers for brain disorders.","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00753-6","numberInSourceReferences":316},{"id":"tmp64311","doi":"10.1186/s13024-023-00685-6","type":"journalArticle","title":"Fluid biomarkers for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a review","authors":[{"LN":"Irwin","FN":"Katherine E."},{"LN":"Sheth","FN":"Udit"},{"LN":"Wong","FN":"Philip C."},{"LN":"Gendron","FN":"Tania F."}],"year":"2024","date":"2024-01-24","journal":"Molecular Neurodegeneration","volume":"19","issue":"1","firstPage":"9","references":[],"abstract":"","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13024-023-00685-6","numberInSourceReferences":319},{"id":"tmp12664","doi":"10.1038/s43587-023-00565-0","type":"journalArticle","title":"Plasma proteomic profiles predict future dementia in healthy adults","authors":[{"LN":"Guo","FN":"Yu"},{"LN":"You","FN":"Jia"},{"LN":"Zhang","FN":"Yi"},{"LN":"Liu","FN":"Weishi"},{"LN":"Huang","FN":"Yuyuan"},{"LN":"Zhang","FN":"Ya-Ru"},{"LN":"Zhang","FN":"Wei"},{"LN":"Dong","FN":"Qiang"},{"LN":"Feng","FN":"Jianfeng"},{"LN":"Cheng","FN":"Wei"},{"LN":"Yu","FN":"Jin-Tai"}],"year":"2024","date":"2024-02-12","journal":"Nature Aging","volume":"4","issue":"2","firstPage":"247","lastPage":"260","references":[],"abstract":"","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-023-00565-0","numberInSourceReferences":320},{"id":"tmp43793","doi":"10.1038/s41586-024-07185-7","type":"journalArticle","title":"APOE4/4 is linked to damaging lipid droplets in Alzheimer’s disease microglia","authors":[{"LN":"Haney","FN":"Michael S."},{"LN":"Pálovics","FN":"Róbert"},{"LN":"Munson","FN":"Christy"},{"LN":"Long","FN":"Chris M."},{"LN":"Johansson","FN":"Patrik K."},{"LN":"Yip","FN":"Oscar"},{"LN":"Dong","FN":"Wentao"},{"LN":"Rawat","FN":"Eshaan S."},{"LN":"West","FN":"Elizabeth"},{"LN":"Schlachetzki","FN":"Johannes C.

However, results are usually interpreted relative to one-size-fits-all reference intervals1,2, undermining the precision medicine goal to tailor care for patients on the basis of their unique characteristics3,4. Here we study thousands of diverse patients at an academic medical centre and show that routine CBC indices fluctuate around stable values or setpoints5, and setpoints are patient-specific, with the typical healthy adult’s nine CBC setpoints distinguishable as a group from those of 98% of other healthy adults, and setpoint differences persist for at least 20 years. Haematological setpoints reflect a deep physiologic phenotype enabling investigation of acquired and genetic determinants of haematological regulation and its variation among healthy adults. Setpoints in apparently healthy adults were associated with significant variation in clinical risk: absolute risk of some common diseases and morbidities varied by more than 2% (heart attack and stroke, diabetes, kidney disease, osteoporosis), and absolute risk of all-cause 10 year mortality varied by more than 5%. Setpoints also define patient-specific reference intervals and personalize the interpretation of subsequent test results. In retrospective analysis, setpoints improved sensitivity and specificity for evaluation of some common conditions including diabetes, kidney disease, thyroid dysfunction, iron deficiency and myeloproliferative neoplasms. This study shows CBC setpoints are sufficiently stable and patient-specific to help realize the promise of precision medicine for healthy adults.","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08264-5","numberInSourceReferences":335},{"id":"tmp84298","doi":"10.1038/s41591-024-03297-9","type":"journalArticle","title":"The use and misuse of ‘biological aging’ in health research","authors":[{"LN":"Ikram","FN":"M.

A subgroup of these participants underwent testing of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), cognitive assessments, and brain imaging at 2-year–to–3-year intervals. A total of 648 participants in whom Alzheimer’s disease developed were matched with 648 participants who had normal cognition, and the temporal trajectories of CSF biochemical marker concentrations, cognitive testing, and imaging were analyzed in the two groups.\n\nDownload a PDF of the Research Summary.\nResults\nThe median follow-up was 19.9 years (interquartile range, 19.5 to 20.2). CSF and imaging biomarkers in the Alzheimer’s disease group diverged from those in the cognitively normal group at the following estimated number of years before diagnosis: amyloid-beta (Aβ)42, 18 years; the ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40, 14 years; phosphorylated tau 181, 11 years; total tau, 10 years; neurofilament light chain, 9 years; hippocampal volume, 8 years; and cognitive decline, 6 years. As cognitive impairment progressed, the changes in CSF biomarker levels in the Alzheimer’s disease group initially accelerated and then slowed.\nConclusions\nIn this study involving Chinese participants during the 20 years preceding clinical diagnosis of sporadic Alzheimer’s disease, we observed the time courses of CSF biomarkers, the times before diagnosis at which they diverged from the biomarkers from a matched group of participants who remained cognitively normal, and the temporal order in which the biomarkers became abnormal.

Understanding this heterogeneity is critical for AD drug development. Here we define AD molecular subtypes using mass spectrometry proteomics in cerebrospinal fluid, based on 1,058 proteins, with different levels in individuals with AD (\n              n\n               = 419) compared to controls (\n              n\n               = 187). These AD subtypes had alterations in protein levels that were associated with distinct molecular processes: subtype 1 was characterized by proteins related to neuronal hyperplasticity; subtype 2 by innate immune activation; subtype 3 by RNA dysregulation; subtype 4 by choroid plexus dysfunction; and subtype 5 by blood–brain barrier impairment. Each subtype was related to specific AD genetic risk variants, for example, subtype 1 was enriched with\n              TREM2\n              R47H. Subtypes also differed in clinical outcomes, survival times and anatomical patterns of brain atrophy. These results indicate molecular heterogeneity in AD and highlight the need for personalized medicine.","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00550-7","numberInSourceReferences":551},{"id":"tmp97423","doi":"10.1038/s41593-024-01737-w","type":"journalArticle","title":"Proteomic

Here we developed a proteomic age clock in the UK Biobank (\n              n\n               = 45,441) using a proteomic platform comprising 2,897 plasma proteins and explored its utility to predict major disease morbidity and mortality in diverse populations. We identified 204 proteins that accurately predict chronological age (Pearson\n              r\n               = 0.94) and found that proteomic aging was associated with the incidence of 18 major chronic diseases (including diseases of the heart, liver, kidney and lung, diabetes, neurodegeneration and cancer), as well as with multimorbidity and all-cause mortality risk. Proteomic aging was also associated with age-related measures of biological, physical and cognitive function, including telomere length, frailty index and reaction time. Proteins contributing most substantially to the proteomic age clock are involved in numerous biological functions, including extracellular matrix interactions, immune response and inflammation, hormone regulation and reproduction, neuronal structure and function and development and differentiation. In a validation study involving biobanks in China (\n              n\n               = 3,977) and Finland (\n              n\n               = 1,990), the proteomic age clock showed similar age prediction accuracy (Pearson\n              r\n               = 0.92 and\n              r\n               = 0.94, respectively) compared to its performance in the UK Biobank.

Age gaps of nine organs were determined from plasma proteins via SomaScan (SomaLogic; Boulder, CO, USA) using the Python package organage. Following this assessment, we tracked participants for 20 years through linkage to national health records. Study outcomes were 45 individual age-related diseases and multimorbidity.\nFindings\nOver 123 712 person-years of observation (mean follow-up 19·8 years [SD 3·6]), after excluding baseline disease cases and adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, and age gaps in organs other than the one under investigation, individuals with large organ age gaps showed an increased risk of 30 diseases. Six diseases were exclusively associated with accelerated ageing of their respective organ: liver failure (hazard ratio [HR] per SD increment in the organ age gap 2·13 [95% CI 1·41–3·22]), dilated cardiomyopathy (HR 1·65 [1·28–2·12]), chronic heart failure (HR 1·52 [1·40–1·65]), lung cancer (HR 1·29 [1·04–1·59]), agranulocytosis (HR 1·27 [1·07–1·51]), and lymphatic node metastasis (HR 1·23 [1·06–1·43]). 24 diseases were associated with more than one organ age gap or with organ age gaps not directly related to the disease location. Larger age gaps were also associated with elevated HRs of developing two or more diseases affecting different organs within the same individual (ie, multiorgan multimorbidity): 2·03 (1·51–2·74) for the arterial age gap, 1·78 (1·48–2·14) for the kidney age gap, 1·52 (1·38–1·68) for the heart age gap, 1·52 (1·12–2·06) for the brain age gap, 1·43 (1·16–1·78) for the pancreas age gap, 1·37 (1·17–1·61) for the lung age gap, 1·36 (1·26–1·46) for the immune system age gap, and 1·30 (1·18–1·42) for the liver age gap.\nInterpretation\nAdvanced proteomic organ ageing is associated with the long-term risk of age-related diseases. In most cases, faster ageing of a specific organ increases susceptibility to morbidity affecting multiple organs.","url":"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(25)00006-8/fulltext","numberInSourceReferences":4},{"id":"ZHZWLF7S","doi":"10.1016/j.cmet.2024.10.005","type":"journalArticle","title":"Plasma protein-based organ-specific aging and mortality models unveil diseases as accelerated aging of organismal systems","authors":[{"LN":"Goeminne","FN":"Ludger J.

It leads to functional decline, disease, and ultimately death, but the relationship between these fundamental biomedical features remains elusive. By applying elastic net regularization to plasma proteome data of over 50,000 human subjects in the UK Biobank and other cohorts, we report interpretable organ-specific and conventional aging models trained on chronological age, mortality, and longitudinal proteome data. These models predict organ/system-specific disease and indicate that men age faster than women in most organs. Accelerated organ aging leads to diseases in these organs, and specific diets, lifestyles, professions, and medications influence organ aging rates. We then identify proteins driving these associations with organ-specific aging. Our analyses reveal that age-related chronic diseases epitomize accelerated organ- and system-specific aging, modifiable through environmental factors, advocating for both universal whole-organism and personalized organ/system-specific anti-aging interventions.</p>","url":"https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/abstract/S1550-4131(24)00401-7","numberInSourceReferences":7},{"id":"DI3S5QYD","doi":"10.1038/s41591-025-03831-3","type":"journalArticle","title":"Disruption of the cerebrospinal fluid–plasma protein balance in cognitive impairment and aging","authors":[{"LN":"Farinas","FN":"Amelia"},{"LN":"Rutledge","FN":"Jarod"},{"LN":"Bot","FN":"Veronica Augustina"},{"LN":"Western","FN":"Daniel"},{"LN":"Ying","FN":"Kejun"},{"LN":"Lawrence","FN":"Kathryn A."},{"LN":"Oh","FN":"Hamilton Se-Hwee"},{"LN":"Yoon","FN":"Seonghyun"},{"LN":"Ding","FN":"Daisy Yi"},{"LN":"Tsai","FN":"Andy P."},{"LN":"Moran-Losada","FN":"Patricia"},{"LN":"Timsina","FN":"Jigyasha"},{"LN":"Le Guen","FN":"Yann"},{"LN":"Montgomery","FN":"Stephen B."},{"LN":"Baker","FN":"David"},{"LN":"Poston","FN":"Kathleen L."},{"LN":"Wagner","FN":"Anthony D."},{"LN":"Mormino","FN":"Elizabeth"},{"LN":"Cruchaga","FN":"Carlos"},{"LN":"Wyss-Coray","FN":"Tony"}],"year":"2025","date":"2025-08","journal":"Nature Medicine","volume":"31","issue":"8","firstPage":"2578","lastPage":"2589","references":["W88BHUV3","tmp27485","tmp15134","tmp22887","tmp29289","tmp19051","tmp00067","tmp36447","tmp40156","JCYR3GXP","tmp29846","tmp98659","tmp81848","tmp23491","tmp47719","tmp33401","tmp54903","tmp30544","tmp62138","tmp33300","tmp33973","tmp02682","tmp22670","tmp60888","tmp05117","tmp62312","tmp88560","tmp60696","tmp15417","tmp77661","tmp59370","tmp77146","tmp91201","tmp33788","tmp00698","tmp44717","HAHVYMGV","tmp46316","tmp98200","tmp18314","tmp50528","tmp47510","tmp68886","tmp72049","tmp84476","tmp08253","tmp98556","tmp42905","tmp61696","tmp41441","tmp02358","tmp89967","tmp10056","tmp71772","tmp34305","tmp72368","tmp94628","tmp98353","tmp38455","tmp16416","tmp27577","tmp24581","tmp13680","tmp40293","tmp06589","tmp56778","tmp85268","tmp05411","tmp02735","tmp81219","tmp38168","tmp93856","tmp29266","IXIVR3HY","tmp67465","tmp20642","tmp54468","tmp20893"],"abstract":"The brain barrier system, including the choroid plexus, meninges and brain vasculature, regulates substrate transport and maintains differential protein concentrations between blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Aging and neurodegeneration disrupt brain barrier function, but proteomic studies of the effects on blood–CSF protein balance are limited. Here we used SomaScan proteomics to characterize paired CSF and plasma samples from 2,171 healthy or cognitively impaired older individuals from multiple cohorts, including the Global Neurodegeneration Proteomics Consortium. We identified proteins with correlated CSF and plasma levels that are produced primarily outside the brain and are enriched for structural domains that may enable their transport across brain barriers. CSF to plasma ratios of 848 proteins increased with aging in healthy control individuals, including complement and coagulation proteins, chemokines and proteins linked to neurodegeneration, whereas 64 protein ratios decreased with age, suggesting substrate-specific barrier regulation. Notably, elevated CSF to plasma ratios of peripherally derived or vascular-associated proteins, including DCUN1D1, MFGE8 and VEGFA, were associated with preserved cognitive function. Genome-wide association studies identified genetic loci associated with CSF to plasma ratios of 241 proteins, many of which have known disease associations, including FCN2, the collagen-like domain of which may facilitate blood–CSF transport. Overall, this work provides molecular insight into the human brain barrier system and its disruption with age and disease, with implications for the development of brain-permeable therapeutics.","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03831-3","numberInSourceReferences":8},{"id":"JCYR3GXP","doi":"10.1038/s41591-025-03565-2","type":"journalArticle","title":"A cerebrospinal fluid synaptic protein biomarker for prediction of cognitive resilience versus decline in Alzheimer’s disease","authors":[{"LN":"Oh","FN":"Hamilton Se-Hwee"},{"LN":"Urey","FN":"Deniz Yagmur"},{"LN":"Karlsson","FN":"Linda"},{"LN":"Zhu","FN":"Zeyu"},{"LN":"Shen","FN":"Yuanyuan"},{"LN":"Farinas","FN":"Amelia"},{"LN":"Timsina","FN":"Jigyasha"},{"LN":"Duggan","FN":"Michael R."},{"LN":"Chen","FN":"Jingsha"},{"LN":"Guldner","FN":"Ian H."},{"LN":"Morshed","FN":"Nader"},{"LN":"Yang","FN":"Chengran"},{"LN":"Western","FN":"Daniel"},{"LN":"Ali","FN":"Muhammad"},{"LN":"Le Guen","FN":"Yann"},{"LN":"Trelle","FN":"Alexandra"},{"LN":"Herukka","FN":"Sanna-Kaisa"},{"LN":"Rauramaa","FN":"Tuomas"},{"LN":"Hiltunen","FN":"Mikko"},{"LN":"Lipponen","FN":"Anssi"},{"LN":"Luikku","FN":"Antti J."},{"LN":"Poston","FN":"Kathleen L."},{"LN":"Mormino","FN":"Elizabeth"},{"LN":"Wagner","FN":"Anthony D."},{"LN":"Wilson","FN":"Edward N."},{"LN":"Channappa","FN":"Divya"},{"LN":"Leinonen","FN":"Ville"},{"LN":"Stevens","FN":"Beth"},{"LN":"Ehrenberg","FN":"Alexander J."},{"LN":"Gottesman","FN":"Rebecca F."},{"LN":"Coresh","FN":"Josef"},{"LN":"Walker","FN":"Keenan A."},{"LN":"Zetterberg","FN":"Henrik"},{"LN":"Bennett","FN":"David A."},{"LN":"Franzmeier","FN":"Nicolai"},{"LN":"Hansson","FN":"Oskar"},{"LN":"Cruchaga","FN":"Carlos"},{"LN":"Wyss-Coray","FN":"Tony"}],"year":"2025","date":"2025-05","journal":"Nature Medicine","volume":"31","issue":"5","firstPage":"1592","lastPage":"1603","references":["tmp85196","tmp61901","tmp91599","tmp82142","tmp58032","tmp29416","tmp38398","tmp44109","tmp36250","tmp91049","tmp71413","tmp85792","tmp68390","tmp84652","tmp18772","tmp30249","tmp65772","tmp52488","tmp63130","tmp26286","tmp67622","tmp31402","tmp13310","tmp33844","tmp24685","tmp70818","tmp24485","tmp44507","tmp92841","tmp09945","tmp84730","tmp55994","tmp86449","tmp13754","tmp11054","tmp76845","GJ2TR6QY","tmp34250","tmp53506","tmp55011","tmp68388","tmp52688","tmp87794","tmp61732","tmp24050","tmp33864","tmp33325","tmp87292","tmp14549","tmp94734","tmp95908","W88BHUV3","tmp23608","tmp96939","tmp27485","tmp15134","tmp20041","tmp39997","tmp12283","tmp52250","tmp80075","tmp30873","tmp00101","tmp67557","tmp95035","tmp87646","tmp22773","tmp59337","tmp04924","tmp26219","tmp22887","tmp29289","tmp73388","tmp55680","tmp10328","tmp78427","tmp13707","tmp47950","tmp19051","tmp56011","tmp48689","tmp00067","tmp15398"],"abstract":"Rates of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are extremely heterogeneous. Although biomarkers for amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau proteins, the hallmark AD pathologies, have improved pathology-based diagnosis, they explain only 20–40% of the variance in AD-related cognitive impairment (CI). To discover novel biomarkers of CI in AD, we performed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics on 3,397 individuals from six major prospective AD case–control cohorts. Synapse proteins emerged as the strongest correlates of CI, independent of Aβ and tau. Using machine learning, we derived the CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 synapse protein ratio, which explained 27% of the variance in CI beyond CSF pTau181:Aβ42, 11% beyond tau positron emission tomography, and 28% beyond CSF neurofilament, growth-associated protein 43 and neurogranin in Aβ+ and phosphorylated tau+ (A+T1+) individuals. CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 also increased with normal aging and 20 years before estimated symptom onset in carriers of autosomal dominant AD mutations. Regarding cognitive prognosis, CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 predicted conversion from A+T1+ cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment (standard deviation increase hazard ratio = 3.0, P = 7.0 × 10–4) and A+T1+ mild cognitive impairment to dementia (standard deviation increase hazard ratio = 2.2, P = 8.2 × 10–16) over a 15-year follow-up, adjusting for CSF pTau181:Aβ42, CSF neurofilament, CSF neurogranin, CSF growth-associated protein 43, age, APOE4 and sex. We also developed a plasma proteomic signature of CI, which we evaluated in 13,401 samples, which partly recapitulated CSF YWHAG:NPTX2. Overall, our findings underscore CSF YWHAG:NPTX2 as a robust prognostic biomarker for cognitive resilience versus AD onset and progression, highlight the potential of plasma proteomics in replacing CSF measurement and further implicate synapse dysfunction as a core driver of AD dementia.","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03565-2","numberInSourceReferences":2},{"id":"HAHVYMGV","doi":"10.1016/j.neuron.2025.02.014","type":"journalArticle","title":"Multi-cohort cerebrospinal fluid proteomics identifies robust molecular signatures across the Alzheimer disease continuum","authors":[{"LN":"Ali","FN":"Muhammad"},{"LN":"Timsina","FN":"Jigyasha"},{"LN":"Western","FN":"Daniel"},{"LN":"Liu","FN":"Menghan"},{"LN":"Beric","FN":"Aleksandra"},{"LN":"Budde","FN":"John"},{"LN":"Do","FN":"Anh"},{"LN":"Heo","FN":"Gyujin"},{"LN":"Wang","FN":"Lihua"},{"LN":"Gentsch","FN":"Jen"},{"LN":"Schindler","FN":"Suzanne E."},{"LN":"Morris","FN":"John C."},{"LN":"Holtzman","FN":"David M."},{"LN":"Ruiz","FN":"Agustin"},{"LN":"Alvarez","FN":"Ignacio"},{"LN":"Aguilar","FN":"Miquel"},{"LN":"Pastor","FN":"Pau"},{"LN":"Rutledge","FN":"Jarod"},{"LN":"Oh","FN":"Hamilton"},{"LN":"Wilson","FN":"Edward N."},{"LN":"Guen","FN":"Yann Le"},{"LN":"Khalid","FN":"Rana R."},{"LN":"Robins","FN":"Chloe"},{"LN":"Pulford","FN":"David J."},{"LN":"Tarawneh","FN":"Rawan"},{"LN":"Ibanez","FN":"Laura"},{"LN":"Wyss-Coray","FN":"Tony"},{"LN":"Sung","FN":"Yun Ju"},{"LN":"Cruchaga","FN":"Carlos"}],"year":"2025","date":"2025-05-07","journal":"Neuron","volume":"113","issue":"9","firstPage":"1363","lastPage":"1379.e9","references":["J5XCQ6KJ","SPF89DRI","tmp29416","tmp84652","tmp55994","tmp29289","tmp00977","tmp61696","tmp98353","tmp21808","tmp80033","tmp61682","tmp95271","tmp62394","tmp88525","tmp17523","tmp19068","tmp86565","tmp65990","tmp64037","tmp74671","tmp85690","tmp45485","tmp89497","tmp03142","tmp72888","tmp36523","RNSC65TU","tmp97423","tmp93221","tmp32090","tmp42030","tmp39805","tmp29653","tmp54302","tmp29193","tmp88612","tmp31137","tmp54431","tmp40639","tmp20747","tmp30822","tmp00595","tmp71009","tmp44001","tmp43344","tmp33586","tmp27896","tmp41860","tmp58700","tmp79617","tmp67803","tmp74925","tmp18452","tmp26413","tmp21344","tmp16926","tmp62327","tmp75511","tmp23859","tmp23273","tmp44056","tmp13619","tmp89572","tmp68349","tmp44324","tmp07999","tmp33132","tmp12467","tmp29196","tmp37100","tmp76092","tmp39101","tmp74709","tmp80028","tmp85316","tmp93055","tmp90778","tmp95468","tmp44813","tmp28140","tmp38391","tmp58070","tmp87363","tmp80734","tmp64367","tmp36128","tmp29542","tmp37572","tmp27397","tmp91141","tmp77652","tmp69839","tmp79114","tmp88769","tmp67527","tmp21780","tmp15436","tmp20300","tmp73809","tmp17591","tmp99938","tmp20473","tmp00814","tmp87555","tmp02799","tmp60984","tmp01583","tmp37538","tmp05074","tmp67922","tmp53082","tmp02498","tmp40360","tmp10815","tmp98344","tmp39313","tmp31045","tmp83192","tmp68787","tmp63483","tmp33753","tmp99859","tmp69284","tmp14947","tmp53007","tmp00187","tmp77147","tmp49026","tmp51906","tmp94616","tmp03444","tmp37101","tmp08092","tmp13031","tmp81412","tmp89788","tmp87645","tmp96723","tmp35813","tmp22599","tmp46315","tmp09034","tmp43889","tmp78235","tmp16136","tmp80296","tmp78695","tmp55102"],"abstract":"Previous article\nNext article\nHighlights\n•\nLarge-scale CSF proteomics identified more than 2,000 associated with AD\n•\nProteomic changes in the AD continuum follow four distinct pseudo-trajectories\n•\nIndividuals positive for the 10-protein panel display higher probability of developing AD\n•\n10-protein AD model predicts the progression to symptomatic AD\nSummary\nChanges in β-amyloid (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau (T) in brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) precede Alzheimer’s disease (AD) symptoms, making the CSF proteome a potential avenue to understand disease pathophysiology and facilitate reliable diagnostics and therapies. Using the AT framework and a three-stage study design (discovery, replication, and meta-analysis), we identified 2,173 analytes (2,029 unique proteins) dysregulated in AD. Of these, 865 (43%) were previously reported, and 1,164 (57%) are novel. The identified proteins cluster in four different pseudo-trajectories groups spanning the AD continuum and were enriched in pathways including neuronal death, apoptosis, and tau phosphorylation (early stages), microglia dysregulation and endolysosomal dysfunction (mid stages), brain plasticity and longevity (mid stages), and microglia-neuron crosstalk (late stages). Using machine learning, we created and validated highly accurate and replicable (area under the curve [AUC] > 0.90) models that predict AD biomarker positivity and clinical status. These models can also identify people that will convert to AD.","url":"https://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(25)00132-1","numberInSourceReferences":9}],"citingArticles":[],"tabLabel":"Zotero Cita Example Proteomics","tabTitle":"Citations retrieved from Crossref on 2026-01-12","API":"Zotero Cita","allCited":true,"allCiting":false,"timestamp":1768255695191,"localCitationNetworkVersion":1.3}]
