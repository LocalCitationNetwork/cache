Recent advances in the development of mobile digitally connected technologies have led to the emergence of a new class of biomarkers measured across multiple layers of hardware and software. Quantified in ones and zeros, these “digital” biomarkers can support continuous measurements outside the physical confines of the clinical environment. The modular software–hardware combination of these products has created new opportunities for patient care and biomedical research, enabling remote monitoring and decentralized clinical trial designs. However, a systematic approach to assessing the quality and utility of digital biomarkers to ensure an appropriate balance between their safety and effectiveness is needed. This paper outlines key considerations for the development and evaluation of digital biomarkers, examining their role in clinical research and routine patient care.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2917347002","numberInSourceReferences":24,"doi":"10.1038/S41746-019-0084-2","title":"Digital biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease: the mobile/wearable devices opportunity","authors":[{"id":"A4350209283","orcid":null,"LN":"Kourtis","FN":"Lampros","affil":"University Medical Center (US), Tufts University (US)"},{"id":"A2800881823","orcid":null,"LN":"Regele","FN":"Oliver B","affil":"Eli Lilly (United States) (US)"},{"id":"A4352106924","orcid":null,"LN":"Wright","FN":"Justin P.","affil":"Eli Lilly (United States) (US), Novartis (United States) (US)"},{"id":"A4357811761","orcid":null,"LN":"Jones","FN":"Graham","affil":"University Medical Center (US), Boston University (US), Tufts University (US), Novartis (United States) (US)"}],"year":2019,"journal":"npj digital medicine (Nature Portfolio)","references":["W39182999","W141877456","W142128493","W188715143","W1599571371","W1600451534","W1607549953","W1696941437","W1853705225","W1867505698","W1932263918","W1967157241","W1970493599","W1971184026","W1975984765","W1976318588","W1980021733","W1980584599","W1983620103","W1994133638","W1994816022","W2004480778","W2007522537","W2011195206","W2011573339","W2012462205","W2016112357","W2019767591","W2026588572","W2030689331","W2039900537","W2040213688","W2042409950","W2061033650","W2062066574","W2062706679","W2069967041","W2070561555","W2078482898","W2079020664","W2081459741","W2082945747","W2084041671","W2084627109","W2085729374","W2089109585","W2090798932","W2094265147","W2114525505","W2116506729","W2118470188","W2121127471","W2121766792","W2123418885","W2124214624","W2129951633","W2130111393","W2132524523","W2144084456","W2144533308","W2147094193","W2148230634","W2158359335","W2159069793","W2166692930","W2209078744","W2232964048","W2235684601","W2266982813","W2293491888","W2314966636","W2328885510","W2397231077","W2509156994","W2510353128","W2524789029","W2524967876","W2527878972","W2528666543","W2602011993","W2625908633","W2743629169","W2759174152","W2764053908","W2773319078","W2773581467","W2783644354","W2785925437","W2790444357","W2791186536","W2791600159","W2795307842","W2801455414","W2807451695","W4242905572","W4298407818"],"citationsCount":180,"abstract":"Abstract Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) represents a major and rapidly growing burden to the healthcare ecosystem. A growing body of evidence indicates that cognitive, behavioral, sensory, and motor changes may precede clinical manifestations of AD by several years. Existing tests designed to diagnose neurodegenerative diseases, while well-validated, are often less effective in detecting deviations from normal cognitive decline trajectory in the earliest stages of the disease. In the quest for gold standards for AD assessment, there is a growing interest in the identification of readily accessible digital biomarkers, which harness advances in consumer grade mobile and wearable technologies. Topics examined include a review of existing early clinical manifestations of AD and a path to the respective sensor and mobile/wearable device usage to acquire domain-centric data towards objective, high frequency and passive digital phenotyping.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2968807426","numberInSourceReferences":15,"doi":"10.1159/000502000","title":"Traditional and Digital Biomarkers: Two Worlds Apart?","authors":[{"id":"A4347535488","orcid":null,"LN":"Babrak","FN":"Lmar","affil":"University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland (CH)"},{"id":"A2801510549","orcid":"0000-0001-5657-1994","LN":"Menetski","FN":"Joseph P.","affil":"Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (US)"},{"id":"A4336457173","orcid":null,"LN":"Rebhan","FN":"Michael","affil":"Novartis (Switzerland) (CH)"},{"id":"A2219295440","orcid":null,"LN":"Nisato","FN":"Giovanni","affil":"Health Hacking Lab, Basel, Switzerland."},{"id":"A2313884168","orcid":"0000-0003-4926-9791","LN":"Zinggeler","FN":"Marc","affil":"Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology (Switzerland) (CH)"},{"id":"A4341556137","orcid":null,"LN":"Brasier","FN":"Noé","affil":"University Hospital of Basel (CH)"},{"id":"A4347490547","orcid":null,"LN":"Baerenfaller","FN":"Katja","affil":"SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (CH), University of Zurich (CH)"},{"id":"A2967265724","orcid":null,"LN":"Brenzikofer","FN":"Thomas","affil":"DayOne, BaselArea.

Objective, high-frequency data can guide critical decision-making in therapeutic development and allow for a more efficient evaluation of therapies of increasingly common disorders.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2954756813","numberInSourceReferences":19,"doi":"10.2196/12785","title":"Current State of Digital Biomarker Technologies for Real-Life, Home-Based Monitoring of Cognitive Function for Mild Cognitive Impairment to Mild Alzheimer Disease and Implications for Clinical Care: Systematic Review","authors":[{"id":"A2308061401","orcid":"0000-0003-2849-3057","LN":"Piau","FN":"Antoine","affil":"Université Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier (FR)"},{"id":"A4345364243","orcid":null,"LN":"Wild","FN":"Katherine","affil":"Oregon Health & Science University (US)"},{"id":"A668326849","orcid":"0000-0003-2623-1969","LN":"Mattek","FN":"Nora","affil":"Oregon Health & Science University (US)"},{"id":"A4359050033","orcid":null,"LN":"Kaye","FN":"Jeffrey","affil":"Oregon Health & Science University (US)"}],"year":2019,"journal":"Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR Publications)","references":["W246286872","W1808375816","W1896392245","W1967197730","W1983174547","W1985030911","W1987561750","W1997718099","W2012777693","W2020298616","W2025241098","W2033345578","W2039772841","W2045299870","W2059743726","W2071694479","W2085187999","W2089095714","W2106716710","W2115017507","W2128765271","W2133114348","W2139206156","W2139609044","W2155579822","W2156098321","W2161182511","W2164962778","W2166780580","W2170516266","W2286190554","W2335127946","W2344257855","W2349757246","W2409233683","W2433546375","W2473313434","W2500662120","W2513273491","W2566554776","W2582524520","W2586341316","W2596241616","W2610948095","W2619185795","W2739009153","W2751879861","W2752744672","W2759771684","W2766134245","W2766920067","W2794553894","W2800798183","W2801132216","W2805638371","W2809528641","W2832962474","W2884974093","W2891525603","W2911417821","W4294215472"],"citationsCount":96,"abstract":"Background Among areas that have challenged the progress of dementia care has been the assessment of change in symptoms over time. Digital biomarkers are defined as objective, quantifiable, physiological, and behavioral data that are collected and measured by means of digital devices, such as embedded environmental sensors or wearables. Digital biomarkers provide an alternative assessment approach, as they allow objective, ecologically valid, and long-term follow-up with continuous assessment. Despite the promise of a multitude of sensors and devices that can be applied, there are no agreed-upon standards for digital biomarkers, nor are there comprehensive evidence-based results for which digital biomarkers may be demonstrated to be most effective. Objective In this review, we seek to answer the following questions: (1) What is the evidence for real-life, home-based use of technologies for early detection and follow-up of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia? And (2) What transformation might clinicians expect in their everyday practices? Methods A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus databases for papers published from inception to July 2018. We searched for studies examining the implementation of digital biomarker technologies for mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer disease follow-up and detection in nonclinic, home-based settings. All studies that included the following were examined: community-dwelling older adults (aged 65 years or older); cognitively healthy participants or those presenting with cognitive decline, from subjective cognitive complaints to early Alzheimer disease; a focus on home-based evaluation for noninterventional follow-up; and remote diagnosis of cognitive deterioration. Results An initial sample of 4811 English-language papers were retrieved. After screening and review, 26 studies were eligible for inclusion in the review. These studies ranged from 12 to 279 participants and lasted between 3 days to 3.6 years. Most common reasons for exclusion were as follows: inappropriate setting (eg, hospital setting), intervention (eg, drugs and rehabilitation), or population (eg, psychiatry and Parkinson disease). We summarized these studies into four groups, accounting for overlap and based on the proposed technological solutions, to extract relevant data: (1) data from dedicated embedded or passive sensors, (2) data from dedicated wearable sensors, (3) data from dedicated or purposive technological solutions (eg, games or surveys), and (4) data derived from use of nondedicated technological solutions (eg, computer mouse movements). Conclusions Few publications dealt with home-based, real-life evaluations. Most technologies were far removed from everyday life experiences and were not mature enough for use under nonoptimal or uncontrolled conditions. Evidence available from embedded passive sensors represents the most relatively mature research area, suggesting that some of these solutions could be proposed to larger populations in the coming decade. The clinical and research communities would benefit from increasing attention to these technologies going forward.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2801834301","numberInSourceReferences":10,"doi":"10.1002/MDS.27376","title":"Evaluation of smartphone-based testing to generate exploratory outcome measures in a phase 1 Parkinson's disease clinical trial","authors":[{"id":"A1957824095","orcid":"0000-0002-8663-819X","LN":"Lipsmeier","FN":"Florian","affil":"Roche (Switzerland) (CH)"},{"id":"A2118693706","orcid":"0000-0002-2480-3137","LN":"Taylor","FN":"Kirsten I.","affil":"Roche (Switzerland) (CH)"},{"id":"A2640670093","orcid":"0000-0003-0904-1522","LN":"Kilchenmann","FN":"Timothy","affil":"Roche (Switzerland) (CH)"},{"id":"A4334591030","orcid":null,"LN":"Wolf","FN":"Detlef","affil":"Roche (Switzerland) (CH)"},{"id":"A2745891703","orcid":"0000-0001-9590-8617","LN":"Scotland","FN":"Alf","affil":"Roche (Switzerland) (CH)"},{"id":"A2748722961","orcid":null,"LN":"Schjodt-Eriksen","FN":"Jens","affil":"Roche (Switzerland) (CH)"},{"id":"A4354406034","orcid":null,"LN":"Cheng","FN":"W.

Objectives: The present study assessed the feasibility, reliability, and validity of smartphone-based digital biomarkers of PD in a clinical trial setting. Methods: During a 6-month, phase 1b clinical trial with 44 Parkinson participants, and an independent, 45-day study in 35 age-matched healthy controls, participants completed six daily motor active tests (sustained phonation, rest tremor, postural tremor, finger-tapping, balance, and gait), then carried the smartphone during the day (passive monitoring), enabling assessment of, for example, time spent walking and sit-to-stand transitions by gyroscopic and accelerometer data. Results: Adherence was acceptable: Patients completed active testing on average 3.5 of 7 times/week. Sensor-based features showed moderate-to-excellent test-retest reliability (average intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.84). All active and passive features significantly differentiated PD from controls with P < 0.005. All active test features except sustained phonation were significantly related to corresponding International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society–Sponsored UPRDS clinical severity ratings. On passive monitoring, time spent walking had a significant (P = 0.005) relationship with average postural instability and gait disturbance scores. Of note, for all smartphone active and passive features except postural tremor, the monitoring procedure detected abnormalities even in those Parkinson participants scored as having no signs in the corresponding International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society–Sponsored UPRDS items at the site visit. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the feasibility of smartphone-based digital biomarkers and indicate that smartphone-sensor technologies provide reliable, valid, clinically meaningful, and highly sensitive phenotypic data in Parkinson's disease. © 2018 The Authors.

Further, the process of transforming data into digital biomarkers is computationally expensive, and standards and validation methods in digital biomarker research are lacking.In order to provide a collaborative, standardized space for digital biomarker research and validation, we present the first comprehensive, open-source software platform for end-to-end digital biomarker development: The Digital Biomarker Discovery Pipeline (DBDP).Here, we detail the general DBDP framework as well as three robust modules within the DBDP that have been developed for specific digital biomarker discovery use cases.The clear need for such a platform will accelerate the DBDP's adoption as the industry standard for digital biomarker development and will support its role as the epicenter of digital biomarker collaboration and exploration.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2963957222","numberInSourceReferences":12,"doi":"10.1136/BMJOPEN-2019-030710","title":"Emergence of digital biomarkers to predict and modify treatment efficacy: machine learning study","authors":[{"id":"A2166625421","orcid":"0000-0002-1458-9798","LN":"Guthrie","FN":"Nicole Lee","affil":"Better Therapeutics LLC, San Francisco, California, USA"},{"id":"A2885562675","orcid":"0000-0002-2896-9871","LN":"Carpenter","FN":"Jason","affil":"Manifold, Inc, Oakland, California, USA"},{"id":"A4357514763","orcid":null,"LN":"Edwards","FN":"Katherine","affil":"Better Therapeutics LLC, San Francisco, California, USA"},{"id":"A2604611155","orcid":"0000-0002-2687-9063","LN":"Appelbaum","FN":"Kevin J","affil":"Better Therapeutics LLC, San Francisco, California, USA"},{"id":"A2913777037","orcid":"0000-0002-5154-5460","LN":"Dey","FN":"Sourav","affil":"Manifold, Inc, Oakland, California, USA"},{"id":"A4354663876","orcid":null,"LN":"Eisenberg","FN":"David","affil":"Harvard University (US)"},{"id":"A4354462981","orcid":null,"LN":"Katz","FN":"David L.","affil":"Better Therapeutics LLC, San Francisco, California, USA, Yale Griffin Prevention Research Center (US), Yale University (US)"},{"id":"A2095858041","orcid":"0000-0003-3124-1934","LN":"Berman","FN":"Mark","affil":"Better Therapeutics LLC, San Francisco, California, USA"}],"year":2019,"journal":"BMJ Open","references":["W1967456880","W1983335031","W2005918389","W2028789193","W2057862039","W2072755146","W2073166512","W2080925448","W2102367710","W2109112922","W2111522975","W2146404132","W2151056789","W2168199710","W2168334156","W2198866495","W2254050631","W2293132087","W2323393982","W2496601852","W2514594369","W2559820773","W2762658547","W2765293807","W2768267412","W2787038658","W2791522323","W2795307842","W2797650827","W2798104555","W2809348670","W2809585336","W2888589263","W2890655815","W2892370045","W2893253160","W2911964244","W2913705661","W2921623465"],"citationsCount":26,"abstract":"Objectives Development of digital biomarkers to predict treatment response to a digital behavioural intervention. Design Machine learning using random forest classifiers on data generated through the use of a digital therapeutic which delivers behavioural therapy to treat cardiometabolic disease. Data from 13 explanatory variables (biometric and engagement in nature) generated in the first 28 days of a 12-week intervention were used to train models. Two levels of response to treatment were predicted: (1) systolic change ≥10 mm Hg (SC model), and (2) shift down to a blood pressure category of elevated or better (ER model). Models were validated using leave-one-out cross validation and evaluated using area under the curve receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) and specificity- sensitivity. Ability to predict treatment response with a subset of nine variables, including app use and baseline blood pressure, was also tested (models SC-APP and ER-APP). Setting Data generated through ad libitum use of a digital therapeutic in the USA. Participants Deidentified data from 135 adults with a starting blood pressure ≥130/80, who tracked blood pressure for at least 7 weeks using the digital therapeutic. Results The SC model had an AUROC of 0.82 and a sensitivity of 58% at a specificity of 90%. The ER model had an AUROC of 0.69 and a sensitivity of 32% at a specificity at 91%. Dropping explanatory variables related to blood pressure resulted in an AUROC of 0.72 with a sensitivity of 42% at a specificity of 90% for the SC-APP model and an AUROC of 0.53 for the ER-APP model. Conclusions Machine learning was used to transform data from a digital therapeutic into digital biomarkers that predicted treatment response in individual participants. Digital biomarkers have potential to improve treatment outcomes in a digital behavioural intervention.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2624915721","numberInSourceReferences":5,"doi":"10.1159/000477382","title":"The New Digital Divide For Digital Biomarkers","authors":[{"id":"A4357340533","orcid":null,"LN":"Torous","FN":"John","affil":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (US), Harvard University (US)"},{"id":"A4355377478","orcid":null,"LN":"Rodriguez","FN":"Jorge Luis","affil":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (US), Harvard University (US)"},{"id":"A4353356720","orcid":null,"LN":"Powell","FN":"Adam C.","affil":"PayPal (United States) (US)"}],"year":2017,"journal":"Digital biomarkers (Karger Publishers)","references":["W1894490285","W2029454745","W2039663770","W2093973716","W2126335261","W2141334117","W2171995598","W2222292469","W2261303017","W2265682271","W2277920276","W2289545039","W2339280460","W2347128633","W2559126868","W2570496662","W2592797645","W2604625614"],"citationsCount":34,"abstract":"As smartphone and sensors continue to become more ubiquitous across the world, digital biomarkers have emerged as a scalable and practical tool to explore disease states and advance health.

A key element in these strategies is the empowerment of individuals to control their health. Self-measurement plays an essential role in achieving such empowerment. Digital measurements have the advantage of being measured non-invasively, passively, continuously, and in a real-world context. An important question is whether such measurement can sensitively measure subtle disbalances in the progression toward disease, as well as the subtle effects of, for example, nutritional improvement. The concept of resilience biomarkers, defined as the dynamic evaluation of the biological response to an external challenge, has been identified as a viable strategy to measure these subtle effects. In this review, we explore the potential of integrating this concept with digital physiological measurements to come to digital resilience biomarkers. Additionally, we discuss the potential of wearable, non-invasive, and continuous measurement of molecular biomarkers. These types of innovative measurements may, in the future, also serve as a digital resilience biomarker to provide even more insight into the personal biological dynamics of an individual. Altogether, digital resilience biomarkers are envisioned to allow for the measurement of subtle effects of health maintenance and disease prevention strategies in a real-world context and thereby give personalized feedback to improve health.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3108822321","numberInSourceReferences":38,"doi":"10.1159/000510820","title":"Evaluation of Speech-Based Digital Biomarkers: Review and Recommendations","authors":[{"id":"A4342813164","orcid":null,"LN":"Robin","FN":"Jessica","affil":"Winterlight Labs, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."},{"id":"A4357981262","orcid":null,"LN":"Harrison","FN":"John","affil":"Cambridge Cognition (United Kingdom) (GB)"},{"id":"A2765339566","orcid":null,"LN":"Kaufman","FN":"Liam D.","affil":"Winterlight Labs, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."},{"id":"A206911289","orcid":"0000-0002-9902-0583","LN":"Rudzicz","FN":"Frank","affil":"St. Michael's Hospital (CA)"},{"id":"A4359267518","orcid":null,"LN":"Simpson","FN":"William R.","affil":"McMaster University (CA)"},{"id":"A2251621759","orcid":"0000-0001-6056-9694","LN":"Yancheva","FN":"Maria","affil":"Winterlight Labs, Toronto, Ontario, Canada."}],"year":2020,"journal":"Digital biomarkers (Karger Publishers)","references":["W1267646904","W1600791756","W1835734472","W1847247712","W1853705225","W1964556518","W1974288165","W1980541833","W1980794267","W2057393928","W2058565790","W2063042856","W2071268704","W2091298722","W2101431309","W2132559335","W2135417772","W2140425743","W2144723972","W2152375843","W2158516192","W2162238982","W2252171711","W2322892874","W2328558348","W2503328419","W2517272260","W2524143035","W2594844191","W2594894191","W2595833406","W2596578278","W2604132829","W2736213625","W2748115049","W2752744672","W2768386871","W2770604845","W2791063712","W2797669327","W2799677743","W2803176146","W2809398825","W2810618178","W2900484088","W2909038951","W2917347002","W2921623465","W2944361236","W2946286144","W2946793373","W2952337070","W2954756813","W2968807426","W2972559945","W2980931499","W2999941287","W3000075668","W3012339291","W3014561849","W3016443966","W3042015757","W4240149198","W4293569649"],"citationsCount":45,"abstract":"Speech represents a promising novel biomarker by providing a window into brain health, as shown by its disruption in various neurological and psychiatric diseases. As with many novel digital biomarkers, however, rigorous evaluation is currently lacking and is required for these measures to be used effectively and safely. This paper outlines and provides examples from the literature of evaluation steps for speech-based digital biomarkers, based on the recent V3 framework (Goldsack et al., 2020). The V3 framework describes 3 components of evaluation for digital biomarkers: verification, analytical validation, and clinical validation. Verification includes assessing the quality of speech recordings and comparing the effects of hardware and recording conditions on the integrity of the recordings. Analytical validation includes checking the accuracy and reliability of data processing and computed measures, including understanding test-retest reliability, demographic variability, and comparing measures to reference standards. Clinical validity involves verifying the correspondence of a measure to clinical outcomes which can include diagnosis, disease progression, or response to treatment. For each of these sections, we provide recommendations for the types of evaluation necessary for speech-based biomarkers and review published examples. The examples in this paper focus on speech-based biomarkers, but they can be used as a template for digital biomarker development more generally.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2996789130","numberInSourceReferences":22,"doi":"10.14245/NS.1938388.194","title":"Internet of Things, Digital Biomarker, and Artificial Intelligence in Spine: Current and Future Perspectives","authors":[{"id":"A4357556721","orcid":null,"LN":"Nam","FN":"Kyoung Won","affil":"Pusan National University Hospital (KR)"},{"id":"A4357777648","orcid":null,"LN":"Kim","FN":"Dong-Hyun","affil":"Pusan National University Hospital (KR)"},{"id":"A4356224947","orcid":null,"LN":"Choi","FN":"Byung Ihn","affil":"Pusan National University Hospital (KR)"},{"id":"A4359372295","orcid":null,"LN":"Han","FN":"In Woong","affil":"Pusan National University Hospital (KR)"}],"year":2019,"journal":"Neurospine (Korean Spinal Neurosurgery Society)","references":["W1899217503","W2006195078","W2109828547","W2507879709","W2512827249","W2541152911","W2566536700","W2576404523","W2588514767","W2593909786","W2596649969","W2615198659","W2761347935","W2762232816","W2768561297","W2775554754","W2779593300","W2779725468","W2785225395","W2789662105","W2790931684","W2793848612","W2794237759","W2800114294","W2801095731","W2801834301","W2884841423","W2887021901","W2896880582","W2900009200","W2901315505","W2902040159","W2904768136","W2909021854","W2912008038","W2917608664","W2919984822","W2920017324","W2921623465","W2931737578","W2932572946","W2943452358","W2947793613","W2951830670","W2954662791","W2955713411","W2964148120","W2966977115","W2976520086","W2979543803"],"citationsCount":28,"abstract":"Recent interest in medical artificial intelligence (AI) has increased with onset of the fourth industrial revolution. Real-time monitoring of patients is an important research area of medical AI. The medical AI is very closely related to the Internet of Things (IoT), a core element of the fourth industrial revolution. Attempts to diagnose and treat patients using IoT have been already applied to patients with chronic disease such as hypertension and arrhythmia. However, in the spine, research on IoT and digital biomarkers are still in the early stages. The digital biomarker obtained by IoT devices is objective and could represent real-time, real-world, and abundant data. Based on its characteristics, IoT and digital biomarkers can also be useful in the spine. Currently, research on real-time monitoring of physical activity or spinal posture is ongoing. Therefore, the authors introduce the basic concepts of IoT and digital biomarkers, their relationship to AI, and recent trends.

Our objective is to describe a more valuable characteristic of digital therapeutics, which is distinct from traditional medicine or therapy: that is, the utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning systems to monitor and predict individual patient symptom data in an adaptive clinical feedback loop via digital biomarkers to provide a precision medicine approach to healthcare. Artificial intelligence platforms can learn and predict effective interventions for individuals using a multitude of personal variables to provide a customized and more tailored therapy regimen. Digital therapeutics coupled with artificial intelligence and machine learning also allows more effective clinical observations and management at the population level for various health conditions and cohorts. This vital differentiation of digital therapeutics compared to other forms of therapeutics enables a more personalized form of healthcare that actively adapts to patients’ individual clinical needs, goals, and lifestyles.

We investigate any discrepancy in learning rates associated with motor and non-motor tasks between PD subjects and healthy controls. The ability of these features to predict self-assigned severity measures is assessed whilst simultaneously inspecting the severity scoring system for floor-ceiling effects. Finally, we study the relationship between motor and non-motor longitudinal behaviour to determine if separate aspects of the disease are dependent on one another.We find that the test performances of the most severe subjects show significant correlations with self-assigned severity measures. Interestingly, less severe subjects do not show significant correlations, which is shown to be a consequence of floor-ceiling effects within the mPower self-reporting severity system. We find that motor performance after practise is a better predictor of severity than baseline performance suggesting that starting performance at a new motor task is less representative of disease severity than the performance after the test has been learnt. We find PD subjects show significant impairments in motor ability as assessed through the alternating finger tapping (AFT) test in both the short- and long-term analyses. In the AFT and memory tests we demonstrate that PD subjects show a larger degree of longitudinal performance variability in addition to requiring more instances of a test to reach a steady state performance than healthy subjects.Our findings pave the way forward for objective assessment and quantification of longitudinal learning rates in PD. This can be particularly useful for symptom monitoring and assessing medication response. This study tries to tackle some of the major challenges associated with self-assessed severity labels by designing and validating features extracted from big datasets in PD, which could help identify digital biomarkers capable of providing measures of disease severity outside of a clinical environment.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2749442893","numberInSourceReferences":4,"doi":"10.1159/000479951","title":"Pharmaceutical Perspective: How Digital Biomarkers and Contextual Data Will Enable Therapeutic Environments","authors":[{"id":"A3146459690","orcid":null,"LN":"Rodarte","FN":"Carlos"}],"year":2017,"journal":"Digital biomarkers (Karger Publishers)","references":["W1522850626","W1972652567","W1977331752","W2033900397","W2086558553","W2125976324","W2144573635","W2235738899","W2250965630","W2395784021","W2566011259","W2569759768","W2575460524","W2591746674","W2698407587","W2738095583"],"citationsCount":14,"abstract":"Digital biomarkers are helping to reshape the understanding of health and disease, which will have an impact in how an individual’s relationship to the environment is assessed, how research is conducted, and how treatment effectiveness is determined.

However, this condition is underdiagnosed. To assist monitoring and screening, digital biomarkers derived from commercial off-the-shelf video games may be of interest. These games maintain player engagement over a longer period of time and support longitudinal measurements of cognitive performance.This paper aims to explore how the player actions of Klondike Solitaire relate to cognitive functions and to what extent the digital biomarkers derived from these player actions are indicative of MCI.First, 11 experts in the domain of cognitive impairments were asked to correlate 21 player actions to 11 cognitive functions. Expert agreement was verified through intraclass correlation, based on a 2-way, fully crossed design with type consistency. On the basis of these player actions, 23 potential digital biomarkers of performance for Klondike Solitaire were defined. Next, 23 healthy participants and 23 participants living with MCI were asked to play 3 rounds of Klondike Solitaire, which took 17 minutes on average to complete. A generalized linear mixed model analysis was conducted to explore the differences in digital biomarkers between the healthy participants and those living with MCI, while controlling for age, tablet experience, and Klondike Solitaire experience.All intraclass correlations for player actions and cognitive functions scored higher than 0.75, indicating good to excellent reliability. Furthermore, all player actions had, according to the experts, at least one cognitive function that was on average moderately to strongly correlated to a cognitive function. Of the 23 potential digital biomarkers, 12 (52%) were revealed by the generalized linear mixed model analysis to have sizeable effects and significance levels. The analysis indicates sensitivity of the derived digital biomarkers to MCI.Commercial off-the-shelf games such as digital card games show potential as a complementary tool for screening and monitoring cognition.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02971124; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02971124.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2992551229","numberInSourceReferences":16,"doi":"10.1159/000504387","title":"Sweat as a Source of Next-Generation Digital Biomarkers","authors":[{"id":"A4341556137","orcid":null,"LN":"Brasier","FN":"Noé","affil":"University Hospital of Basel (CH)"},{"id":"A2104233931","orcid":"0000-0002-1693-9851","LN":"Eckstein","FN":"Jens","affil":"University Hospital of Basel (CH)"}],"year":2019,"journal":"Digital biomarkers (Karger Publishers)","references":["W183470822","W901067443","W1548680965","W1558455145","W1968447690","W2004905658","W2008244458","W2024572769","W2040435093","W2041463870","W2042194530","W2043940791","W2066375239","W2075545307","W2079422913","W2099105888","W2100418264","W2105339897","W2105527159","W2105588659","W2110185282","W2111501560","W2114905492","W2117559755","W2126854757","W2127095067","W2135484472","W2146808467","W2206334972","W2221713709","W2259349518","W2266175888","W2296282946","W2412234046","W2517436571","W2572627412","W2582657518","W2607347870","W2612250156","W2756021421","W2756438808","W2767776450","W2776322741","W2802678962","W2806578062","W2884271132","W2886195200","W2897928730","W2900586747","W2901548714","W2921623465","W2947656395","W2951465783","W2966925761","W2968807426"],"citationsCount":42,"abstract":"Sweat has been associated with health and disease ever since it was linked to high body temperature and exercise.

Digital biomarkers are of increasing interest because they deliver various relevant longitudinal health data. To date, investigations on digital biomarkers have focused on creating objective measurements of function. Sweat analysis using smartphone-based biosensors has the potential to provide initial noninvasive metabolic feedback and therefore represents a promising complement and a source for next-generation digital biomarkers.

With regard to its broad application in various fields of medicine, we see a clear need to evolve the internet-enabled field of sweat expertise: iSudorology.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3164056298","numberInSourceReferences":58,"doi":"10.1038/S41746-021-00465-W","title":"Engineering digital biomarkers of interstitial glucose from noninvasive smartwatches","authors":[{"id":"A2893194690","orcid":"0000-0002-7039-0177","LN":"Bent","FN":"Brinnae","affil":"Duke University (US)"},{"id":"A4359091574","orcid":null,"LN":"Cho","FN":"Peter Siu Pan","affil":"Duke University (US)"},{"id":"A4353441560","orcid":null,"LN":"Henriquez","FN":"Maria A","affil":"Duke University (US)"},{"id":"A4342835620","orcid":null,"LN":"Wittmann","FN":"April H.","affil":"Duke Medical Center (US)"},{"id":"A4344159902","orcid":null,"LN":"Thacker","FN":"Connie R.","affil":"Duke Medical Center (US)"},{"id":"A4345083759","orcid":null,"LN":"Feinglos","FN":"Mark N.","affil":"Duke Medical Center (US)"},{"id":"A4354914113","orcid":null,"LN":"Crowley","FN":"Matthew J","affil":"Duke Medical Center (US)"},{"id":"A2168592699","orcid":"0000-0002-3241-8183","LN":"Dunn","FN":"Jessilyn","affil":"Duke University Hospital (US), Duke Medical Center (US), Duke University (US)"}],"year":2021,"references":["W1481045036","W1531505795","W1558608907","W1577783343","W1872244446","W1965812329","W1969618675","W1973259490","W1985505691","W1999068490","W1999914836","W2003697795","W2004870840","W2014024197","W2019407738","W2020267609","W2027098051","W2027583754","W2031351839","W2050768254","W2059423411","W2059743234","W2098857312","W2103287911","W2104498985","W2107797783","W2108453323","W2109660469","W2113384757","W2113649482","W2120339204","W2122808710","W2126838326","W2126945908","W2127364835","W2129512027","W2130296687","W2134459161","W2135271043","W2140791028","W2141594798","W2152154407","W2161551604","W2166554413","W2169834902","W2170920749","W2171801645","W2175465469","W2231185364","W2332254719","W2345328813","W2402879045","W2483176502","W2531349863","W2553533554","W2565997769","W2748918265","W2772852580","W2773496631","W2774612537","W2792140820","W2802474588","W2802550858","W2802895148","W2803526767","W2809144128","W2883478711","W2891178783","W2893814198","W2895746197","W2913275455","W2913349237","W2914059200","W2914376548","W2969285423","W2988194088","W3004967085","W3016443966","W3042750741","W4212961339","W4239349741","W4243295303"],"citationsCount":19,"abstract":"Abstract Prediabetes affects one in three people and has a 10% annual conversion rate to type 2 diabetes without lifestyle or medical interventions. Management of glycemic health is essential to prevent progression to type 2 diabetes. However, there is currently no commercially-available and noninvasive method for monitoring glycemic health to aid in self-management of prediabetes. There is a critical need for innovative, practical strategies to improve monitoring and management of glycemic health. In this study, using a dataset of 25,000 simultaneous interstitial glucose and noninvasive wearable smartwatch measurements, we demonstrated the feasibility of using noninvasive and widely accessible methods, including smartwatches and food logs recorded over 10 days, to continuously detect personalized glucose deviations and to predict the exact interstitial glucose value in real time with up to 84% and 87% accuracy, respectively. We also establish methods for designing variables using data-driven and domain-driven methods from noninvasive wearables toward interstitial glucose prediction.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3031172897","numberInSourceReferences":30,"doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-32622-7_14","title":"Digital Biomarkers Based Individualized Prognosis for People at Risk of Dementia: the AltoidaML Multi-site External Validation Study","authors":[{"id":"A4337742498","orcid":null,"LN":"Rai","FN":"Laura","affil":"Trinity College Dublin (IE)"},{"id":"A2928009156","orcid":"0000-0003-0787-6892","LN":"Boyle","FN":"Rory","affil":"Trinity College Dublin (IE)"},{"id":"A3032184507","orcid":null,"LN":"Brosnan","FN":"Laura","affil":"Trinity College Dublin (IE)"},{"id":"A3029252123","orcid":null,"LN":"Rice","FN":"Hannah","affil":"Trinity College Dublin (IE)"},{"id":"A4357427095","orcid":null,"LN":"Farina","FN":"Francesca","affil":"Trinity College Dublin (IE)"},{"id":"A1918810313","orcid":null,"LN":"Tarnanas","FN":"Ioannis","affil":"Altoida AG, Lucerne, Switzerland, Trinity College Dublin (IE)"},{"id":"A4353315172","orcid":null,"LN":"Whelan","FN":"Robert","affil":"Trinity College Dublin (IE)"}],"year":2020,"journal":"Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology (Springer Nature)","references":["W1980283223","W2033427845","W2065338300","W2072533873","W2093602450","W2102508963","W2148143831","W2152163581","W2205216748","W2577478840","W2735045133","W2736213625","W2766003287","W2780732598","W2795440516","W2889611173","W2917347002","W2928002646","W2944492170","W2945363574","W2947944623","W2950283932","W2973037195","W2974138729","W3102476541","W4233026002"],"citationsCount":4,"abstract":"Research investigating treatments and interventions for cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) suffer due to difficulties in accurately identifying individuals at risk of AD in the pre-symptomatic stages of the disease. There is an urgent need for better identification of such individuals in order to enable earlier treatment and to properly stage and stratify participants for clinical trials and intervention studies. Although some biological measures (biomarkers) can identify Alzheimer’s-related changes before significant changes in cognitive function occur, such biomarkers are not ideal as they are only able to place individuals in rudimentary stages of the disease/cognitive decline (Tarnanas et al., Alzheimers Dement (Amst) 1(4):521–532, 2015) and sometimes mistakenly diagnose individuals (Edmonds et al. 2015). Two tests, based on real-world functioning, which have been used to screen for pre-symptomatic AD are (i) dual-task walking tests (Belghali et al. 2017) and (ii) day-out tasks (Tarnanas et al. 2013). A novel digital biomarker, the Altoida ADPS app, which implements gamified versions of these tests has been shown to accurately discriminate between healthy controls and individuals in prodromal stages of Alzheimer’s disease (Tarnanas et al. 2013) and can differentiate between people with mild cognitive impairment who convert to Alzheimer’s disease and those who don’t (Tarnanas et al. 2015b). The aim of this study is the validation of a novel digital biomarker of cognitive decline.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3059668454","numberInSourceReferences":31,"doi":"10.1002/DAD2.12073","title":"Digital biomarker‐based individualized prognosis for people at risk of dementia","authors":[{"id":"A3065208123","orcid":null,"LN":"Buegler","FN":"Maximilian","affil":"Altoida Inc., Houston, Texas, USA"},{"id":"A4347614553","orcid":null,"LN":"Harms","FN":"Robbert L.","affil":"Altoida Inc., Houston, Texas, USA"},{"id":"A4356304841","orcid":null,"LN":"Balasa","FN":"Mircea","affil":"Global Brain Health Institute (US), Trinity College Dublin (IE)"},{"id":"A4350316153","orcid":null,"LN":"Meier","FN":"Irene B.","affil":"Altoida Inc., Houston, Texas, USA"},{"id":"A4355732977","orcid":null,"LN":"Exarchos","FN":"Themis P.","affil":"Bioinformatics and Human Electrophysiology Laboratory, Corfu, Greece"},{"id":"A4337742498","orcid":null,"LN":"Rai","FN":"Laura","affil":"Trinity College Dublin (IE)"},{"id":"A2928009156","orcid":"0000-0003-0787-6892","LN":"Boyle","FN":"Rory","affil":"Trinity College Dublin (IE)"},{"id":"A4344731202","orcid":null,"LN":"Tort","FN":"Adria","affil":"Institut d'Investigació Biomèdica August Pi i Sunyer Carrer del Rosselló  Barcelona Spain"},{"id":"A3076209557","orcid":null,"LN":"Kozori","FN":"Maha","affil":"Greek Association of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (GR)"},{"id":"A2890641443","orcid":null,"LN":"Lazarou","FN":"Eutuxia","affil":"Greek Association of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (GR)"},{"id":"A3060402522","orcid":null,"LN":"Rampini","FN":"Michaela","affil":"Centro San Giovanni di Dio Fatebenefratelli (IT), Istituti di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IT)"},{"id":"A2722135536","orcid":"0000-0002-3297-2213","LN":"Cavaliere","FN":"Carlo","affil":"SDN Istituto di Ricerca Diagnostica e Nucleare (IT), Istituti di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IT)"},{"id":"A1121199489","orcid":"0000-0003-0053-7847","LN":"Vlamos","FN":"Panayiotis","affil":"Bioinformatics and Human Electrophysiology Laboratory, Corfu, Greece"},{"id":"A4355731216","orcid":null,"LN":"Tsolaki","FN":"Magda","affil":"AHEPA University Hospital (GR), Information Technologies Institute (GR), Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (GR), Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (GR)"},{"id":"A4356533902","orcid":null,"LN":"Babiloni","FN":"Claudio","affil":"Sapienza University of Rome (IT), University of Cassino and Southern Lazio (IT)"},{"id":"A4344845433","orcid":null,"LN":"Soricelli","FN":"Andrea","affil":"AHEPA University Hospital (GR), Parthenope University of Naples (IT)"},{"id":"A4359827250","orcid":null,"LN":"Frisoni","FN":"Giovanni B.","affil":"University of Geneva (CH), Centro San Giovanni di Dio Fatebenefratelli (IT), Istituti di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IT), Memory Clinic and LANVIE, Geneva, Switzerland, University of Brescia (IT)"},{"id":"A4359950697","orcid":null,"LN":"Sánchez-Valle","FN":"Raquel","affil":"Hospital Clínic de Barcelona (ES), Consorci Institut D'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi I Sunyer (ES)"},{"id":"A4353315172","orcid":null,"LN":"Whelan","FN":"Robert","affil":"Trinity College Dublin (IE)"},{"id":"A1159731508","orcid":null,"LN":"Merlo-Pich","FN":"Emilio","affil":"Takeda (Japan) (JP)"},{"id":"A1918810313","orcid":null,"LN":"Tarnanas","FN":"Ioannis","affil":"Altoida Inc., Houston, Texas, USA, Global Brain Health Institute (US), Trinity College Dublin (IE), Ionian University (GR)"}],"year":2020,"journal":"Alzheimer's & Dementia: Diagnosis, Assessment & Disease Monitoring (Elsevier BV)","references":["W1971042691","W1980283223","W1999733637","W2016358822","W2027576789","W2033427845","W2065338300","W2072533873","W2093602450","W2102211300","W2102508963","W2140348797","W2148143831","W2152163581","W2205216748","W2512273414","W2577478840","W2587438326","W2735045133","W2736213625","W2762301636","W2766003287","W2780732598","W2795440516","W2807758560","W2889611173","W2899428230","W2928002646","W2945363574","W2947944623","W2950283932","W2973037195","W2974138729","W3059668454","W3102476541"],"citationsCount":19,"abstract":"Background Research investigating treatments and interventions for cognitive decline fail due to difficulties in accurately recognizing behavioral signatures in the presymptomatic stages of the disease.

Objective To determine which digital outcome measures of mobility discriminate mobility in people with PD from healthy control (HC) subjects over a week of continuous monitoring. Methods We recruited 29 people with PD, and 27 age-matched HC subjects. Subjects were asked to wear three inertial sensors (Opal by APDM) attached to both feet and to the lumbar region, and a subset of subjects also wore two wrist sensors, for a week of continuous monitoring. We derived 43 digital outcome measures of mobility grouped into five domains. An Area Under Curve (AUC) was calculated for each digital outcome measures of mobility, and logistic regression employing a 'best subsets selection strategy' was used to find combinations of measures that discriminated mobility in PD from HC. Results Duration of recordings was 66±14 hours in the PD and 59±16 hours in the HC. Out of a total of 43 digital outcome measures of mobility, we found six digital outcome measures of mobility with AUC > 0.80. Turn angle (AUC = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.79-0.97) and swing time variability (AUC = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.75-0.96) were the most discriminative individual measures. Turning measures were most consistently selected via the best subsets strategy to discriminate people with PD from HC, followed by gait variability measures. Conclusion Clinical studies and clinical practice with digital biomarkers of daily life mobility in PD should include turning and variability measures.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3047346431","numberInSourceReferences":34,"doi":"10.2196/17818","title":"Using Machine Learning and Smartphone and Smartwatch Data to Detect Emotional States and Transitions: Exploratory Study","authors":[{"id":"A2152104422","orcid":"0000-0002-9272-4326","LN":"Sultana","FN":"Madeena","affil":"University of Calgary (CA)"},{"id":"A4351426922","orcid":null,"LN":"Al-Jefri","FN":"Majed","affil":"University of Calgary (CA)"},{"id":"A4358864278","orcid":null,"LN":"Lee","FN":"Joon Seong","affil":"University of Calgary (CA)"}],"year":2020,"journal":"Jmir mhealth and uhealth (JMIR Publications)","references":["W565833860","W1859669582","W1906543112","W2003653478","W2008264338","W2023736093","W2065864529","W2148143831","W2149628368","W2156567116","W2290270843","W2321609854","W2415188425","W2514431209","W2604757304","W2605108175","W2767586789","W2783583489","W2795423566","W2888288032","W2891525603","W2915095068","W2949366704","W2963373106","W2979385867"],"citationsCount":19,"abstract":"Background Emotional state in everyday life is an essential indicator of health and well-being. However, daily assessment of emotional states largely depends on active self-reports, which are often inconvenient and prone to incomplete information. Automated detection of emotional states and transitions on a daily basis could be an effective solution to this problem. However, the relationship between emotional transitions and everyday context remains to be unexplored. Objective This study aims to explore the relationship between contextual information and emotional transitions and states to evaluate the feasibility of detecting emotional transitions and states from daily contextual information using machine learning (ML) techniques. Methods This study was conducted on the data of 18 individuals from a publicly available data set called ExtraSensory. Contextual and sensor data were collected using smartphone and smartwatch sensors in a free-living condition, where the number of days for each person varied from 3 to 9. Sensors included an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a compass, location services, a microphone, a phone state indicator, light, temperature, and a barometer. The users self-reported approximately 49 discrete emotions at different intervals via a smartphone app throughout the data collection period. We mapped the 49 reported discrete emotions to the 3 dimensions of the pleasure, arousal, and dominance model and considered 6 emotional states: discordant, pleased, dissuaded, aroused, submissive, and dominant. We built general and personalized models for detecting emotional transitions and states every 5 min. The transition detection problem is a binary classification problem that detects whether a person’s emotional state has changed over time, whereas state detection is a multiclass classification problem. In both cases, a wide range of supervised ML algorithms were leveraged, in addition to data preprocessing, feature selection, and data imbalance handling techniques. Finally, an assessment was conducted to shed light on the association between everyday context and emotional states. Results This study obtained promising results for emotional state and transition detection. The best area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve for emotional state detection reached 60.55% in the general models and an average of 96.33% across personalized models. Despite the highly imbalanced data, the best AUROC curve for emotional transition detection reached 90.5% in the general models and an average of 88.73% across personalized models. In general, feature analyses show that spatiotemporal context, phone state, and motion-related information are the most informative factors for emotional state and transition detection. Our assessment showed that lifestyle has an impact on the predictability of emotion. Conclusions Our results demonstrate a strong association of daily context with emotional states and transitions as well as the feasibility of detecting emotional states and transitions using data from smartphone and smartwatch sensors.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2806112435","numberInSourceReferences":6,"doi":"10.1159/000489224","title":"The Best Digital Biomarkers Papers of 2017","authors":[{"id":"A4357557230","orcid":null,"LN":"Snyder","FN":"Christopher M.","affil":"University of Rochester Medical Center (US)"},{"id":"A4356611114","orcid":null,"LN":"Dorsey","FN":"E.

The widespread use of digital devices, such as smartphones and wearables, enables the collection and use of vast amounts of user-generated data as “digital biomarkers.” These tools may also support increased participation of psychiatric patients in research and, as a result, the production of research results that are meaningful to them. However, sharing mental health data and research results may expose patients to discrimination and stigma risks, thus discouraging participation. To earn and maintain participants' trust, the first essential requirement is to implement an appropriate data governance system with a clear and transparent allocation of data protection duties and responsibilities among the actors involved in the process. These include sponsors, investigators, operators of digital tools, as well as healthcare service providers and biobanks/databanks. While previous works have proposed practical solutions to this end, there is a lack of consideration of positive data protection law issues in the extant literature. To start filling this gap, this paper discusses the GDPR legal qualifications of controller, processor, and joint controllers in the complex ecosystem unfolded by the integration of digital biomarkers in psychiatric research, considering their implications and proposing some general practical recommendations.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4288065773","numberInSourceReferences":112,"doi":"10.2196/35722","title":"Digital Biomarker–Based Studies: Scoping Review of Systematic Reviews","authors":[{"id":"A2798299525","orcid":null,"LN":"Motahari-Nezhad","FN":"Hossein"},{"id":"A4288335078","orcid":"0000-0002-6658-8164","LN":"Fgaier","FN":"Meriem"},{"id":"A4353299567","orcid":null,"LN":"Abid","FN":"Mohamed"},{"id":"A4353572542","orcid":null,"LN":"Péntek","FN":"Márta"},{"id":"A4355487735","orcid":null,"LN":"Gulácsi","FN":"László"},{"id":"A4357222592","orcid":null,"LN":"Zrubka","FN":"Zsombor"}],"year":2022,"journal":"Jmir mhealth and uhealth (JMIR Publications)","references":["W1725363947","W1870903963","W1966976587","W2080349934","W2300243664","W2301820471","W2559820773","W2732150368","W2759174152","W2767543826","W2801834301","W2890655815","W2891378911","W2894098752","W2900339363","W2907230884","W2909145757","W2913335608","W2920954231","W2921623465","W2922526452","W2927358919","W2944340769","W2944492170","W2945344227","W2955585842","W2957896895","W2963957222","W2964144124","W2966673978","W2968807426","W2972306940","W2980252214","W2982816732","W2985306752","W2985758825","W2986026434","W2994974106","W2996789130","W3004291740","W3016231786","W3016341785","W3017761351","W3024909861","W3025463389","W3025555717","W3032766692","W3033837745","W3040810687","W3044761805","W3046277417","W3047026678","W3080917251","W3082897316","W3087846344","W3088108321","W3089965568","W3092128750","W3094734549","W3097300016","W3104879713","W3112155844","W3133762983","W3135128169","W3153796453","W3160353426","W3165278286","W3181959214","W3183633169","W3189844228","W3201788237","W3210937733","W3211129172","W4200053422","W4205192005","W4212879173","W4212957127","W4221073130","W4224217719","W4249004226","W4294214983","W4312674524"],"citationsCount":5,"abstract":"Sensors and digital devices have revolutionized the measurement, collection, and storage of behavioral and physiological data, leading to the new term digital biomarkers.This study aimed to investigate the scope of clinical evidence covered by systematic reviews (SRs) of randomized controlled trials involving digital biomarkers.This scoping review was organized using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. With the search limited to English publications, full-text SRs of digital biomarkers included randomized controlled trials that involved a human population and reported changes in participants' health status. PubMed and the Cochrane Library were searched with time frames limited to 2019 and 2020. The World Health Organization's classification systems for diseases (International Classification of Diseases, Eleventh Revision), health interventions (International Classification of Health Interventions), and bodily functions (International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health [ICF]) were used to classify populations, interventions, and outcomes, respectively.A total of 31 SRs met the inclusion criteria. The majority of SRs studied patients with circulatory system diseases (19/31, 61%) and respiratory system diseases (9/31, 29%). Most of the prevalent interventions focused on physical activity behavior (16/31, 52%) and conversion of cardiac rhythm (4/31, 13%). Looking after one's health (physical activity; 15/31, 48%), walking (12/31, 39%), heart rhythm functions (8/31, 26%), and mortality (7/31, 23%) were the most commonly reported outcomes. In total, 16 physiological and behavioral data groups were identified using the ICF tool, such as looking after one's health (physical activity; 14/31, 45%), walking (11/31, 36%), heart rhythm (7/31, 23%), and weight maintenance functions (7/31, 23%). Various digital devices were also studied to collect these data in the included reviews, such as smart glasses, smartwatches, smart bracelets, smart shoes, and smart socks for measuring heart functions, gait pattern functions, and temperature. A substantial number (24/31, 77%) of digital biomarkers were used as interventions. Moreover, wearables (22/31, 71%) were the most common types of digital devices. Position sensors (21/31, 68%) and heart rate sensors and pulse rate sensors (12/31, 39%) were the most prevalent types of sensors used to acquire behavioral and physiological data in the SRs.In recent years, the clinical evidence concerning digital biomarkers has been systematically reviewed in a wide range of study populations, interventions, digital devices, and sensor technologies, with the dominance of physical activity and cardiac monitors. We used the World Health Organization's ICF tool for classifying behavioral and physiological data, which seemed to be an applicable tool to categorize the broad scope of digital biomarkers identified in this review. To understand the clinical value of digital biomarkers, the strength and quality of the evidence on their health consequences need to be systematically evaluated.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3203791779","numberInSourceReferences":71,"doi":"10.3389/FPSYT.2021.740292","title":"On Blurry Boundaries When Defining Digital Biomarkers: How Much Biology Needs to Be in a Digital Biomarker?","authors":[{"id":"A2672582449","orcid":"0000-0001-8112-0837","LN":"Montag","FN":"Christian","affil":"University of Ulm (DE)"},{"id":"A4354376684","orcid":null,"LN":"Elhai","FN":"Jon D.","affil":"University of Toledo (US)"},{"id":"A250660398","orcid":null,"LN":"Dagum","FN":"Paul","affil":"Applied Cognition, Los Altos, CA, United States"}],"year":2021,"journal":"Frontiers in Psychiatry (Frontiers Media)","references":["W91108901","W1894490285","W1973055895","W2039759229","W2078355974","W2083379571","W2146036155","W2154662468","W2436825778","W2593909786","W2608336788","W2745140364","W2768262152","W2789119179","W2789662105","W2795307842","W2808491842","W2899093837","W2905362701","W2917347002","W2924823958","W2954756813","W2969825720","W2976226163","W2983549836","W2985304779","W2986271391","W2996789130","W3012180041","W3016227911","W3028078961","W3034362267","W3042750741","W3049758936","W3097942801","W3098683985","W3120178795","W3158830017","W3172951206","W4237190028"],"citationsCount":22,"abstract":"Recent years have seen a rise in research where so called \"digital biomarkers\" represent the focal study interest.

Given the lack of consensus on how to define a digital biomarker, the present short mini-review provides i) an overview on various definitions and ii) distinguishes between direct (narrow) or indirect (broad) concepts of digital biomarkers. From our perspective, digital biomarkers meant as a more direct (or narrow) concept describe digital footprints being directly linked to biological variables, such as stemming from molecular genetics, epigenetics, endocrinology, immunology or brain imaging, to name a few. More indirect concepts of digital biomarkers encompass digital footprints being linked to human behavior that may act as latent variables indirectly linked to biological variables.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3181959214","numberInSourceReferences":66,"doi":"10.3390/DIAGNOSTICS11071275","title":"Digital Biomarkers for Neuromuscular Disorders: A Systematic Scoping Review","authors":[{"id":"A3129754008","orcid":"0000-0001-5228-6627","LN":"Youn","FN":"Bo-Young","affil":"Kyung Hee University (KR)"},{"id":"A2271502348","orcid":"0000-0002-7055-8531","LN":"Ko","FN":"Youme","affil":"Kyung Hee University (KR)"},{"id":"A2305814367","orcid":null,"LN":"Moon","FN":"Seunghwan","affil":"Kyung Hee University (KR)"},{"id":"A4359282199","orcid":null,"LN":"Lee","FN":"Jin Hee","affil":"Kyung Hee University (KR)"},{"id":"A2136060411","orcid":null,"LN":"Ko","FN":"Seung-Gyu","affil":"Kyung Hee University (KR)"},{"id":"A4356649367","orcid":null,"LN":"Kim","FN":"Jee Hyun","affil":"Department of Neurology, Cheongna Best Rehabilitation Hospital, Incheon 22883, Korea"}],"year":2021,"journal":"Diagnostics (MDPI)","references":["W1981476290","W1997718099","W2060737725","W2084154288","W2294748375","W2299177375","W2405706360","W2410609393","W2547702360","W2555671962","W2580187899","W2593909786","W2732150368","W2766920067","W2883738174","W2891378911","W2917347002","W2921623465","W2967197869","W2976945409","W2996789130","W3015620020","W3026401112","W3047520484","W3082897316","W3093484458","W3110175868","W3118199047"],"citationsCount":13,"abstract":"Biomarkers play a vital role in clinical care.

Older adults living with MCI have a higher chance of progressing to dementia, which warrants regular cognitive follow-up at memory clinics. However, due to time and resource constraints, this follow-up is conducted at separate moments in time with large intervals in between. Casual games, embedded into the daily life of older adults, may prove to be a less resource-intensive medium that yields continuous and rich data on a patient's cognition.To explore whether digital biomarkers of cognitive performance, found in the casual card game Klondike Solitaire, can be used to train machine-learning models to discern games played by older adults living with MCI from their healthy counterparts.Digital biomarkers of cognitive performance were captured from 23 healthy older adults and 23 older adults living with MCI, each playing 3 games of Solitaire with 3 different deck shuffles. These 3 deck shuffles were identical for each participant. Using a supervised stratified, 5-fold, cross-validated, machine-learning procedure, 19 different models were trained and optimized for F1 score.The 3 best performing models, an Extra Trees model, a Gradient Boosting model, and a Nu-Support Vector Model, had a cross-validated F1 training score on the validation set of ≥0.792. The F1 score and AUC of the test set were, respectively, >0.811 and >0.877 for each of these models. These results indicate psychometric properties comparative to common cognitive screening tests.The results suggest that commercial card games, not developed to address specific mental processes, may be used for measuring cognition. The digital biomarkers derived from Klondike Solitaire show promise and may prove useful to fill the current blind spot between consultations.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3127377019","numberInSourceReferences":78,"doi":"10.3233/JPD-202428","title":"Digital Progression Biomarkers as Novel Endpoints in Clinical Trials: A Multistakeholder Perspective","authors":[{"id":"A4341980979","orcid":null,"LN":"Stephenson","FN":"Diane","affil":"Critical Path Institute (US)"},{"id":"A2769810602","orcid":"0000-0002-9291-7240","LN":"Badawy","FN":"Reham","affil":"University of Birmingham (GB)"},{"id":"A2211509499","orcid":null,"LN":"Mathur","FN":"Soania","affil":"Unshakeable MD, Toronto, ON, Canada"},{"id":"A4346320474","orcid":null,"LN":"Tome","FN":"Maria B.","affil":"European Medicines Agency (NL)"},{"id":"A4353467410","orcid":null,"LN":"Rochester","FN":"Lynn","affil":"Newcastle University (GB), E-mail:"}],"year":2021,"journal":"Journal of Parkinson's disease (IOS Press)","references":["W91108901","W1581756795","W2179556309","W2296350496","W2343290709","W2536561406","W2589875191","W2607865678","W2732150368","W2763160983","W2789662105","W2803176146","W2891364748","W2893814198","W2904404980","W2905029490","W2945893512","W2958882697","W2961776418","W2964957938","W2968807426","W2981988319","W2999479734","W3008374045","W3013547516","W3013584252","W3016443966","W3041685226","W3044501361","W3080862813","W3089922264","W3091790184","W3093779917","W3094580235","W3107368598","W3109533980","W3120345228"],"citationsCount":20,"abstract":"The burden of Parkinson's disease (PD) continues to grow at an unsustainable pace particularly given that it now represents the fastest growing brain disease. Despite seminal discoveries in genetics and pathogenesis, people living with PD oftentimes wait years to obtain an accurate diagnosis and have no way to know their own prognostic fate once they do learn they have the disease. Currently, there is no objective biomarker to measure the onset, progression, and severity of PD along the disease continuum. Without such tools, the effectiveness of any given treatment, experimental or conventional cannot be measured. Such tools are urgently needed now more than ever given the rich number of new candidate therapies in the pipeline. Over the last decade, millions of dollars have been directed to identify biomarkers to inform progression of PD typically using molecular, fluid or imaging modalities. These efforts have produced novel insights in our understanding of PD including mechanistic targets, disease subtypes and imaging biomarkers. While we have learned a lot along the way, implementation of robust disease progression biomarkers as tools for quantifying changes in disease status or severity remains elusive. Biomarkers have improved health outcomes and led to accelerated drug approvals in key areas of unmet need such as oncology. Quantitative biomarker measures such as HbA1c a standard test for the monitoring of diabetes has impacted patient care and management, both for the healthcare professionals and the patient community. Such advances accelerate opportunities for early intervention including prevention of disease in high-risk individuals. In PD, progression markers are needed at all stages of the disease in order to catalyze drug development-this allows interventions aimed to halt or slow disease progression (very early) but also facilitates symptomatic treatments at moderate stages of the disease. Recently, attention has turned to the role of digital health technologies to complement the traditional modalities as they are relatively low cost, objective and scalable. Success in this endeavor would be transformative for clinical research and therapeutic development. Consequently, significant investment has led to a number of collaborative efforts to identify and validate suitable digital biomarkers of disease progression.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3088687258","numberInSourceReferences":28,"doi":"10.1159/000509724","title":"A Thorough Examination of Morning Activity Patterns in Adults with Arthritis and Healthy Controls Using Actigraphy Data","authors":[{"id":"A2687168800","orcid":"0000-0001-5917-6308","LN":"Keogh","FN":"Alison","affil":"University College Dublin (IE)"},{"id":"A274351354","orcid":"0000-0002-4505-0090","LN":"Sett","FN":"Niladri","affil":"University College Dublin (IE)"},{"id":"A4337060599","orcid":null,"LN":"Donnelly","FN":"Seamas C.","affil":"Trinity College Dublin (IE)"},{"id":"A4346711589","orcid":null,"LN":"Mullan","FN":"Ronan H","affil":"Trinity College Dublin (IE)"},{"id":"A2899370141","orcid":null,"LN":"Gheta","FN":"Diana","affil":"Tallaght Hospital (IE)"},{"id":"A3088880798","orcid":null,"LN":"Maher-Donnelly","FN":"Martina","affil":"Trinity College Dublin (IE)"},{"id":"A2230276186","orcid":null,"LN":"Illiano","FN":"Vittorio P.","affil":"Novartis (Switzerland) (CH)"},{"id":"A4338239543","orcid":null,"LN":"Calvo","FN":"Francesc","affil":"Novartis (Switzerland) (CH)"},{"id":"A4338239458","orcid":null,"LN":"Dorn","FN":"Jonas F.","affil":"Novartis (Switzerland) (CH)"},{"id":"A114965032","orcid":"0000-0003-2518-0274","LN":"Namee","FN":"Brian Mac","affil":"University College Dublin (IE)"},{"id":"A2222294690","orcid":"0000-0003-0290-9587","LN":"Caulfield","FN":"Brian","affil":"University College Dublin (IE)"}],"year":2020,"journal":"Digital biomarkers (Karger Publishers)","references":["W1904849135","W1977671373","W2007095758","W2045799657","W2064328850","W2094239722","W2096749422","W2108707936","W2109784184","W2110361951","W2124641284","W2125807217","W2125991357","W2158697513","W2169641763","W2246410853","W2264875820","W2465612755","W2512118262","W2624915721","W2767597097","W2777469204","W2782466666","W2803176146","W2883623866","W2894527383","W2897312149","W2921623465","W2952271261","W2963957222","W2995867727","W3021222207"],"citationsCount":5,"abstract":"&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Background:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Wearable sensors allow researchers to remotely capture digital health data, including physical activity, which may identify digital biomarkers to differentiate healthy and clinical cohorts. To date, research has focused on high-level data (e.g., overall step counts) which may limit our insights to &lt;i&gt;whether&lt;/i&gt; people move differently, rather than &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; they move differently. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Objective:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; This study therefore aimed to use actigraphy data to thoroughly examine activity patterns during the first hours following waking in arthritis patients (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 45) and healthy controls (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 30). &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Participants wore an Actigraph GT9X Link for 28 days. Activity counts were analysed and compared over varying epochs, ranging from 15 min to 4 h, starting with waking in the morning. The sum, and a measure of rate of change of cumulative activity in the period immediately after waking (area under the curve [AUC]) for each time period, was calculated for each participant, each day, and individual and group means were calculated. Two-tailed independent &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; tests determined differences between the groups. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; No differences were seen for summed activity counts across any time period studied. However, differences were noted in the AUC analysis for the discrete measures of relative activity. Specifically, within the first 15, 30, 45, and 60 min following waking, the AUC for activity counts was significantly higher in arthritis patients compared to controls, particularly at the 30 min period (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; = –4.24, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0002). Thus, while both cohorts moved the same amount, the way in which they moved was different. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; This study is the first to show that a detailed analysis of actigraphy variables could identify activity pattern changes associated with arthritis, where the high-level daily summaries did not. Results suggest discrete variables derived from raw data may be useful to help identify clinical cohorts and should be explored further to determine if they may be effective clinical biomarkers.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3091889055","numberInSourceReferences":65,"doi":"10.1111/CTS.12910","title":"Digitally Enabled, Patient‐Centric Clinical Trials: Shifting the Drug Development Paradigm","authors":[{"id":"A4341293808","orcid":null,"LN":"Dockendorf","FN":"Marissa F.","affil":"MSD (United States) (US)"},{"id":"A4335445380","orcid":null,"LN":"Hansen","FN":"Bryan","affil":"MSD (United States) (US)"},{"id":"A4348649571","orcid":null,"LN":"Bateman","FN":"Kevin P.","affil":"MSD (United States) (US)"},{"id":"A4352638088","orcid":null,"LN":"Moyer","FN":"Matthew T.","affil":"MSD (United States) (US)"},{"id":"A4359390172","orcid":null,"LN":"Kotnala","FN":"R.K.","affil":"MSD (United States) (US)"},{"id":"A4344310044","orcid":null,"LN":"Shipley","FN":"Lisa A.","affil":"MSD (United States) (US)"}],"year":2020,"journal":"Clinical and Translational Science (Wiley-Blackwell)","references":["W1600791756","W1700762969","W2018502477","W2026561491","W2044369525","W2079951953","W2095305121","W2112747875","W2117608391","W2119562205","W2125340427","W2143909167","W2159068723","W2163672276","W2194276201","W2235738899","W2267786496","W2302501749","W2318583543","W2439951792","W2468224956","W2507704171","W2522666140","W2575460524","W2583501307","W2590881186","W2604186734","W2609231773","W2769992457","W2770034111","W2773648663","W2775554754","W2779593300","W2789596203","W2796423005","W2796755539","W2802596141","W2807369642","W2810221000","W2895372591","W2895533263","W2896442240","W2899241554","W2900081888","W2915663023","W2917347002","W2921623465","W2943335553","W2944361236","W2947943311","W2954012220","W2955115483","W2956154159","W2961654886","W2972256036","W2981988319","W2999310244","W3000358872","W3004694254","W3005348902","W3014220863","W3014307806","W3015857697","W3032972595"],"citationsCount":16,"abstract":"The rapidly advancing field of digital health technologies provides a great opportunity to radically transform the way clinical trials are conducted and to shift the clinical trial paradigm from a site-centric to a patient-centric model. Merck's (Kenilworth, NJ) digitally enabled clinical trial initiative is focused on introduction of digital technologies into the clinical trial paradigm to reduce patient burden, improve drug adherence, provide a means of more closely engaging with the patient, and enable higher quality, faster, and more frequent data collection. This paper will describe the following four key areas of focus from Merck's digitally enabled clinical trials initiative, along with corresponding enabling technologies: (i) use of technologies that can monitor and improve drug adherence (smart dosing), (ii) collection of pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and biomarker samples in an outpatient setting (patient-centric sampling), (iii) use of digital devices to collect and measure physiological and behavioral data (digital biomarkers), and (iv) use of data platforms that integrate digital data streams, visualize data in real-time, and provide a means of greater patient engagement during the trial (digital platform). Furthermore, this paper will discuss the synergistic power in implementation of these approaches jointly within a trial to enable better understanding of adherence, safety, efficacy, PK, PD, and corresponding exposure-response relationships of investigational therapies as well as reduced patient burden for clinical trial participation. Obstacle and challenges to adoption and full realization of the vision of patient-centric, digitally enabled trials will also be discussed.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3116041319","numberInSourceReferences":67,"doi":"10.1159/000512207","title":"Survey on Acceptance of Passive Technology Monitoring for Early Detection of Cognitive Impairment","authors":[{"id":"A4351014710","orcid":null,"LN":"Josephy-Hernandez","FN":"Sylvia","affil":"Massachusetts General Hospital (US), University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School (US)"},{"id":"A2344706220","orcid":null,"LN":"Norise","FN":"Catherine","affil":"University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School (US)"},{"id":"A3116573267","orcid":null,"LN":"Han","FN":"Jee-young","affil":"University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School (US)"},{"id":"A2885437888","orcid":null,"LN":"Smith","FN":"Kara M.","affil":"University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School (US)"}],"year":2020,"references":["W1580331389","W1977976842","W1985030911","W1997718099","W2033345578","W2093274439","W2128765271","W2473313434","W2751879861","W2793752340","W2802596141","W2885961219","W2903517662","W2944361236","W2944434778","W2947110395","W2954756813","W2968807426","W3007652327","W3042816362"],"citationsCount":2,"abstract":"Digital biomarkers may act as a tool for early detection of changes in cognition.

Thirty-eight percent of those with a higher degree of experience with technology were likely to agree to monitoring versus 20% of those with less experience with technology (p = 0.003). Sixty-two percent of non-health-care professionals were likely to agree to monitoring versus 45% of health-care workers (p = 0.012). There were significant concerns regarding privacy (p < 0.01). We compared the surveys answered in Spanish in Costa Rica via logistic regression (n = 43, total n = 216), adjusting for age, education level, health-care profession, owning a smartphone, experience with technology, and perception of cognitive decline. Costa Rican/Spanish-speaking respondents were 7 times more likely to select a high probability of agreeing to such a technology (p < 0.01). English-speaking respondents from the USA were 5 times more likely to be concerned about the impact on health insurance (p = 0.001) and life insurance (p = 0.01).Understanding public perception and ethical implications should guide the design of digital biomarkers for cognition.

Social isolation is a known risk factor for late-life depression, and a potential component of social-isolation is the lack of home visits. Therefore, home visits may serve as a digital measure for social isolation and late-life depression. Late-life depression is a common mental and emotional disorder in the growing population of older adults. The disorder, if untreated, can significantly decrease quality of life and, amongst other effects, leads to increased mortality. Late-life depression often goes undiagnosed due to associated stigma and the incorrect assumption that it is a normal part of ageing. In this work, we propose a visit detection system that generalizes well to previously unseen apartments - which may differ largely in layout, sensor placement, and size from apartments found in the semi-annotated training dataset. We find that by using a self-training-based domain adaptation strategy, a robust system to extract home visit information can be built (ROC AUC = 0.773). We further show that the resulting visit information correlates well with the common geriatric depression scale screening tool ( ρ = -0.87, p = 0.001), providing further support for the idea of utilizing the extracted information as a potential digital measure or even as a digital biomarker to monitor the risk of late-life depression.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3163328251","numberInSourceReferences":57,"doi":"10.2196/26540","title":"Predicting Depression From Smartphone Behavioral Markers Using Machine Learning Methods, Hyperparameter Optimization, and Feature Importance Analysis: Exploratory Study","authors":[{"id":"A2888965328","orcid":"0000-0003-1986-1006","LN":"Asare","FN":"Kennedy Opoku"},{"id":"A2565296084","orcid":"0000-0003-4091-5048","LN":"Terhorst","FN":"Yannik"},{"id":"A4334346525","orcid":null,"LN":"Vega","FN":"Julio"},{"id":"A2137025723","orcid":"0000-0002-3374-671X","LN":"Peltonen","FN":"Ella"},{"id":"A4345618789","orcid":null,"LN":"Lagerspetz","FN":"Eemil"},{"id":"A4356230419","orcid":null,"LN":"Ferreira","FN":"Denzil"}],"year":2021,"references":["W1596515083","W1942695462","W1951724000","W1971560161","W1976132052","W1980616363","W1984796397","W1995875735","W2003457959","W2003689160","W2048533792","W2055800023","W2068055929","W2073190199","W2074732075","W2078074240","W2092716166","W2100822595","W2102636708","W2110065044","W2110417468","W2115098571","W2120571294","W2121746381","W2147085624","W2148143831","W2154290668","W2156567116","W2158435945","W2164104699","W2164111579","W2234472895","W2244501064","W2252241921","W2265900626","W2290270843","W2347128633","W2517889164","W2520441859","W2521795478","W2728794304","W2737034073","W2752663532","W2794672066","W2794997027","W2802769465","W2803035186","W2805638371","W2809351553","W2890085824","W2915095068","W2917347002","W2919915583","W2944492170","W2946726116","W2947402118","W2953459655","W2955308548","W2955527179","W2968407320","W2972933107","W2981182836","W2981742694","W3012180041","W3043210715","W3047346431","W3049624046","W3082445411","W3084378266","W3087276057","W3087590708","W3092460422","W3102476541","W3126710441","W4211101039","W4238376688"],"citationsCount":29,"abstract":"Background Depression is a prevalent mental health challenge. Current depression assessment methods using self-reported and clinician-administered questionnaires have limitations. Instrumenting smartphones to passively and continuously collect moment-by-moment data sets to quantify human behaviors has the potential to augment current depression assessment methods for early diagnosis, scalable, and longitudinal monitoring of depression. Objective The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of predicting depression with human behaviors quantified from smartphone data sets, and to identify behaviors that can influence depression. Methods Smartphone data sets and self-reported 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) depression assessments were collected from 629 participants in an exploratory longitudinal study over an average of 22.1 days (SD 17.90; range 8-86). We quantified 22 regularity, entropy, and SD behavioral markers from the smartphone data. We explored the relationship between the behavioral features and depression using correlation and bivariate linear mixed models (LMMs). We leveraged 5 supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms with hyperparameter optimization, nested cross-validation, and imbalanced data handling to predict depression. Finally, with the permutation importance method, we identified influential behavioral markers in predicting depression. Results Of the 629 participants from at least 56 countries, 69 (10.97%) were females, 546 (86.8%) were males, and 14 (2.2%) were nonbinary. Participants’ age distribution is as follows: 73/629 (11.6%) were aged between 18 and 24, 204/629 (32.4%) were aged between 25 and 34, 156/629 (24.8%) were aged between 35 and 44, 166/629 (26.4%) were aged between 45 and 64, and 30/629 (4.8%) were aged 65 years and over. Of the 1374 PHQ-8 assessments, 1143 (83.19%) responses were nondepressed scores (PHQ-8 score &lt;10), while 231 (16.81%) were depressed scores (PHQ-8 score ≥10), as identified based on PHQ-8 cut-off. A significant positive Pearson correlation was found between screen status–normalized entropy and depression (r=0.14, P&lt;.001). LMM demonstrates an intraclass correlation of 0.7584 and a significant positive association between screen status–normalized entropy and depression (β=.48, P=.03). The best ML algorithms achieved the following metrics: precision, 85.55%-92.51%; recall, 92.19%-95.56%; F1, 88.73%-94.00%; area under the curve receiver operating characteristic, 94.69%-99.06%; Cohen κ, 86.61%-92.90%; and accuracy, 96.44%-98.14%. Including age group and gender as predictors improved the ML performances. Screen and internet connectivity features were the most influential in predicting depression. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that behavioral markers indicative of depression can be unobtrusively identified from smartphone sensors’ data. Traditional assessment of depression can be augmented with behavioral markers from smartphones for depression diagnosis and monitoring.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3092410709","numberInSourceReferences":32,"doi":"10.3389/FDGTH.2020.567158","title":"Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment Through Natural Language and Touchscreen Typing Processing","authors":[{"id":"A3091923578","orcid":null,"LN":"Ntracha","FN":"Anastasia","affil":"Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (GR)"},{"id":"A4347573969","orcid":null,"LN":"Iakovakis","FN":"Dimitrios","affil":"Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (GR)"},{"id":"A4358215419","orcid":null,"LN":"Hadjidimitriou","FN":"Stelios","affil":"Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (GR)"},{"id":"A4358168169","orcid":null,"LN":"Charisis","FN":"Vasileios","affil":"Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (GR)"},{"id":"A4355731216","orcid":null,"LN":"Tsolaki","FN":"Magda","affil":"Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (GR)"},{"id":"A4355488013","orcid":null,"LN":"Hadjileontiadis","FN":"Leontios J.","affil":"Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (GR), Khalifa University of Science and Technology (AE)"}],"year":2020,"journal":"Frontiers in digital health (Frontiers Media)","references":["W1599571371","W1847168837","W1853705225","W1958678786","W1963487177","W1994133638","W1994871153","W2011195206","W2020439496","W2023057624","W2028436804","W2050067419","W2067495470","W2084025070","W2085729374","W2089109585","W2091524551","W2112224561","W2112519660","W2122888777","W2132322340","W2132559335","W2136520115","W2138911066","W2140250041","W2150780222","W2158516192","W2158600149","W2159122349","W2160150599","W2164258891","W2404801683","W2482793140","W2506075369","W2602555460","W2732150368","W2783644354","W2801987007","W2807561669","W2898180128","W2899752978","W2902390331","W2917347002","W2925077947","W2964250703","W2965957880","W2973854560","W3045732690"],"citationsCount":15,"abstract":"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), an identified prodromal stage of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), often evades detection in the early stages of the condition, when existing diagnostic methods are employed in the clinical setting. From an alternative perspective, smartphone interaction behavioral data, unobtrusively acquired in a non-clinical setting, can assist the screening and monitoring of MCI and its symptoms' progression. In this vein, the diagnostic ability of digital biomarkers, drawn from Fine Motor Impairment (FMI)- and Spontaneous Written Speech (SWS)-related data analysis, are examined here. In particular, keystroke dynamics derived from touchscreen typing activities, using Convolutional Neural Networks, along with linguistic features of SWS through Natural Language Processing (NLP), were used to distinguish amongst MCI patients and healthy controls (HC). Analytically, three indices of FMI (rigidity, bradykinesia and alternate finger tapping) and nine NLP features, related with lexical richness, grammatical, syntactical complexity, and word deficits, formed the feature space. The proposed approach was tested on two demographically matched groups of 11 MCI patients and 12 HC, having undergone the same neuropsychological tests, producing 4,930 typing sessions and 78 short texts, within 6 months, for analysis. A cascaded-classifier scheme was realized under three different feature combinations and validated via a Leave-One-Subject-Out cross-validation scheme. The acquired results have shown: (a) keystroke features with a k-NN classifier achieved an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.78 [95% confidence interval (CI):0.68-0.88; specificity/sensitivity (SP/SE): 0.64/0.92], (b) NLP features with a Logistic regression classifier achieved an AUC of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.65-0.85; SP/SE: 0.80/0.71), and (c) an ensemble model with the fusion of keystroke and NLP features resulted in AUC of 0.75 (95% CI:0.63-0.86; SP/SE 0.90/0.60). The current findings indicate the potentiality of new digital biomarkers to capture early stages of cognitive decline, providing a highly specific remote screening tool in-the-wild.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3097651466","numberInSourceReferences":45,"doi":"10.1038/S41746-020-00351-X","title":"Harnessing consumer smartphone and wearable sensors for clinical cancer research","authors":[{"id":"A2100269163","orcid":"0000-0002-3318-7495","LN":"Low","FN":"Carissa A.","affil":"University of Pittsburgh (US)"}],"year":2020,"journal":"npj digital medicine (Nature Portfolio)","references":["W1894490285","W1975984765","W2023540185","W2056134801","W2098094536","W2111255119","W2177958589","W2413118791","W2520441859","W2524125023","W2559181347","W2564914915","W2588852707","W2592797645","W2605624450","W2620691393","W2620925856","W2622304196","W2759174152","W2761225994","W2767597097","W2767880786","W2771061271","W2781276926","W2789418272","W2791128136","W2800471500","W2802274028","W2807451695","W2808816741","W2810071873","W2810084185","W2810240533","W2811363092","W2885287589","W2898810824","W2899502878","W2907378463","W2909145757","W2921623465","W2942129951","W2942805235","W2943315623","W2945334377","W2956026528","W2957730340","W2961446758","W2961813557","W2963641566","W2965096667","W2969672147","W2972211076","W2973921853","W2981564501","W2983979686","W2988471173","W2994992573","W2997815778","W2999462476","W3003847510","W3004653943","W3015023997","W3015773152","W3016487077","W3021019568"],"citationsCount":42,"abstract":"Abstract As smartphones and consumer wearable devices become more ubiquitous, there is a growing opportunity to capture rich mobile sensor data continuously, passively, and in real-world settings with minimal burden. In the context of cancer, changes in these passively sensed digital biomarkers may reflect meaningful variation in functional status, symptom burden, quality of life, and risk for adverse clinical outcomes. These data could enable real-time remote monitoring of patients between clinical encounters and more proactive, comprehensive, and personalized care. Over the past few years, small studies across a variety of cancer populations support the feasibility and potential clinical value of mobile sensors in oncology. Barriers to implementing mobile sensing in clinical oncology care include the challenges of managing and making sense of continuous sensor data, patient engagement issues, difficulty integrating sensor data into existing electronic health systems and clinical workflows, and ethical and privacy concerns. Multidisciplinary collaboration is needed to develop mobile sensing frameworks that overcome these barriers and that can be implemented at large-scale for remote monitoring of deteriorating health during or after cancer treatment or for promotion and tailoring of lifestyle or symptom management interventions. Leveraging digital technology has the potential to enrich scientific understanding of how cancer and its treatment affect patient lives, to use this understanding to offer more timely and personalized support to patients, and to improve clinical oncology outcomes.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4221073130","numberInSourceReferences":118,"doi":"10.1038/S41746-022-00583-Z","title":"Digital biomarkers: Convergence of digital health technologies and biomarkers","authors":[{"id":"A2573472325","orcid":"0000-0001-6314-5328","LN":"Vasudevan","FN":"Srikanth","affil":"Center for Devices and Radiological Health (US)"},{"id":"A4341204230","orcid":null,"LN":"Saha","FN":"Anindita","affil":"Center for Devices and Radiological Health (US), United States Food and Drug Administration (US)"},{"id":"A4354286375","orcid":null,"LN":"Tarver","FN":"Michelle E.","affil":"Center for Devices and Radiological Health (US), United States Food and Drug Administration (US)"},{"id":"A4336090496","orcid":null,"LN":"Patel","FN":"Bakul","affil":"Center for Devices and Radiological Health (US), United States Food and Drug Administration (US)"}],"year":2022,"journal":"npj digital medicine (Nature Portfolio)","references":["W2402006737","W2795881110","W2987985090","W2999749474","W3121986904"],"citationsCount":18,"abstract":"Increasing digitization across the healthcare continuum has revolutionized medical research, diagnostics, and therapeutics.

Data aggregation, sampling rate minimization, and effective data compression are all methods for consolidating wearable sensor data to reduce data volumes. There has been limited research on appropriate, effective, and efficient data compression methods for biosignal data. Here, we examine the application of different data compression pipelines built using combinations of algorithmic- and encoding-based methods to biosignal data from wearable sensors and explore how these implementations affect data recoverability and storage footprint. Algorithmic methods tested include singular value decomposition, the discrete cosine transform, and the biorthogonal discrete wavelet transform. Encoding methods tested include run-length encoding and Huffman encoding. We apply these methods to common wearable sensor data, including electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), accelerometry, electrodermal activity (EDA), and skin temperature measurements. Of the methods examined in this study and in line with the characteristics of the different data types, we recommend direct data compression with Huffman encoding for ECG, and PPG, singular value decomposition with Huffman encoding for EDA and accelerometry, and the biorthogonal discrete wavelet transform with Huffman encoding for skin temperature to maximize data recoverability after compression. We also report the best methods for maximizing the compression ratio. Finally, we develop and document open-source code and data for each compression method tested here, which can be accessed through the Digital Biomarker Discovery Pipeline as the “Biosignal Data Compression Toolbox,” an open-source, accessible software platform for compressing biosignal data.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3128435890","numberInSourceReferences":61,"doi":"10.3389/FCVM.2021.617682","title":"Case Report: Ambient Sensor Signals as Digital Biomarkers for Early Signs of Heart Failure Decompensation","authors":[{"id":"A4353811547","orcid":null,"LN":"Saner","FN":"Hugo","affil":"University of Bern (CH), University Hospital of Bern (CH)"},{"id":"A3107478136","orcid":null,"LN":"Schuetz","FN":"Narayan","affil":"University of Bern (CH)"},{"id":"A2762897099","orcid":"0000-0001-6577-200X","LN":"Buluschek","FN":"Philipp"},{"id":"A3043218012","orcid":null,"LN":"Pasquier","FN":"Guillaume du"},{"id":"A3127820444","orcid":null,"LN":"Ribaudo","FN":"Giuseppe"},{"id":"A2443187763","orcid":"0000-0002-7641-8898","LN":"Urwyler","FN":"Prabitha","affil":"University of Bern (CH), University Hospital of Bern (CH)"},{"id":"A4343981350","orcid":null,"LN":"Nef","FN":"Tobias","affil":"University of Bern (CH)"}],"year":2021,"journal":"Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine (Frontiers Media)","references":["W2016762450","W2586341316","W2610602137","W2793514470","W2896612302","W2907117825","W2954539192","W2967208919","W2991443759","W3007492756","W3037058216","W3042932002","W3108308769"],"citationsCount":8,"abstract":"Home monitoring systems are increasingly used to monitor seniors in their apartments for detection of emergency situations.

However, the digital phenotype, which refers to the analysis of data collected by measuring human behavior with mobile sensors and smart bracelets, is a promising tool for filling this gap in current clinical practice. Objective The objectives of this study are to develop the digital phenotyping of patients with alcohol use disorder and anxiety symptoms using data collected from a mobile device (ie, smartphone) and a wearable sensor (ie, Fitbit) and to analyze usability and patient satisfaction with the data collection service provided by the app. Methods We propose to conduct a study among a group of 60 participants split into two subgroups—experimental and control—of 30 participants each. The experimental group will be recruited by physicians from the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, and the control group will be recruited on a volunteer basis through fliers and social media. All participants will go through pretraining to ensure technological capability and understanding of tasks, then each participant will download the HumanITcare app and will be given a wearable sensor (ie, Fitbit). Throughout the 4-month period, participants will be monitored on a range of factors, including sleep cycle, heart rate, movement patterns, and sociability. All data from the wearable sensors and the mobile devices will be saved and sent to the HumanITcare server. Participants will be asked to complete weekly questionnaires about anxiety, depression, and alcohol use disorder symptoms. Research assistants will ensure timely responses. The data from both sensors will then be compared to the questionnaire responses to determine how accurately the devices can predict the same symptoms. Results The recruitment phase was completed in November 2019 and all the data were collected by the end of December 2019. Data are being processed; this process is expected to be completed by October 2020. Conclusions This study was created and conducted as a pilot study with the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, with the purpose of exploring the feasibility of our approach. The study is focused on patients diagnosed with anxiety and alcohol use disorder, but participants were also monitored for depressive symptoms throughout the trial, although these were not part of the initial inclusion criteria. A limitation to our study was the exclusive use of Android smartphones over iOS devices; this could result in a potential selection bias, due to the accessibility and affordability of Android phones as opposed to iOS-based phones. Another limitation might be that reviews of usability and satisfaction could be confounded by factors such as age and familiarity. An additional function that we might add in future studies is the ability for patients to manage their own data.

Digital biomarkers can be extracted and used as indicators for health and disease. Signal acquisition is either by object sensors, wearable sensors, or contact-free sensors including cameras, pressure sensors, non-contact capacitively coupled electrocardiogram (cECG), radar, and passive infrared motion sensors. This review summarizes contemporary knowledge of the use of contact-free sensors for patients with cardiovascular disease and healthy subjects following the PRISMA declaration. Chances and challenges are discussed. Thirty-six publications were rated to be of medium (31) or high (5) relevance. Results are best for monitoring of heart rate and heart rate variability using cardiac vibration, facial camera, or cECG; for respiration using cardiac vibration, cECG, or camera; and for sleep using ballistocardiography. Early results from radar sensors to monitor vital signs are promising. Contact-free sensors are little invasive, well accepted and suitable for long-term monitoring in particular in patient's homes. A major problem are motion artefacts. Results from long-term use in larger patient cohorts are still lacking, but the technology is about to emerge the market and we can expect to see more clinical results in the near future.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3044898809","numberInSourceReferences":41,"doi":"10.3389/FNHUM.2020.00245","title":"Digital Biomarkers for the Early Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment: Artificial Intelligence Meets Virtual Reality","authors":[{"id":"A3042322635","orcid":null,"LN":"Cavedoni","FN":"Silvia","affil":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano (IT)"},{"id":"A2063717309","orcid":"0000-0002-4587-0232","LN":"Chirico","FN":"Alice","affil":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart (IT)"},{"id":"A1945838697","orcid":"0000-0003-4012-262X","LN":"Pedroli","FN":"Elisa","affil":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano (IT), Università degli Studi eCampus (IT)"},{"id":"A101076526","orcid":"0000-0002-0662-7678","LN":"Cipresso","FN":"Pietro","affil":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano (IT), Catholic University of the Sacred Heart (IT)"},{"id":"A4357674078","orcid":null,"LN":"Riva","FN":"Giuseppe","affil":"Istituto Auxologico Italiano (IT), Catholic University of the Sacred Heart (IT)"}],"year":2020,"journal":"Frontiers in Human Neuroscience (Frontiers Media)","references":["W1967737804","W1968126294","W1968703316","W1971760095","W1992054897","W1993990114","W1995277044","W2001215426","W2004315874","W2008321350","W2018877033","W2019459953","W2021761995","W2028436804","W2032254925","W2043297459","W2044081264","W2045585730","W2049589449","W2054451473","W2058924226","W2061654059","W2061699647","W2069568588","W2075286557","W2076148729","W2076891970","W2077900769","W2080718748","W2083780116","W2086771214","W2087016914","W2090695467","W2092685533","W2093602450","W2098932274","W2102508963","W2103679334","W2107229253","W2113199056","W2115017507","W2115529939","W2117684832","W2118397262","W2120111102","W2120345115","W2121860971","W2123626849","W2131242371","W2133841825","W2133951477","W2135168472","W2142824220","W2145839404","W2148158693","W2156087784","W2157994299","W2159122349","W2159534445","W2160439953","W2165840723","W2166293122","W2258968934","W2294269162","W2315198558","W2321270736","W2323125838","W2327143220","W2354144140","W2395172628","W2404901863","W2488786095","W2515391985","W2554758707","W2567013021","W2569531558","W2578946531","W2582524520","W2587438326","W2594139863","W2610332124","W2724719322","W2734248302","W2737411423","W2738920916","W2739350124","W2747563181","W2752381652","W2753973739","W2780732598","W2783944165","W2787427645","W2796972283","W2811088743","W2884493876","W2885603777","W2888015509","W2890480785","W2895123855","W2897916980","W2898298942","W2898543815","W2899316042","W2905810301","W2907505805","W2912412749","W2919115771","W2920968489","W2921623465","W2921637243","W2944210554","W2945314100","W2950278227","W2955252073","W2958243193","W2959398397","W2969912247","W2970535471","W2972064872","W2972201147","W2974138729","W2981647338","W2984353870","W2985355520","W2990734087","W2991541823","W2992695826","W2992895046","W3101420358","W3104265065","W4231109964","W4247665917","W4295135118"],"citationsCount":23,"abstract":"Elderly people affected by Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) usually report a perceived decline in cognitive functions that deeply impacts their quality of life. This subtle waning, although it cannot be diagnosable as dementia, is noted by caregivers on the basis of their relative's behaviors. Crucially, if this condition is also not detected in time by clinicians, it can easily turn into dementia. Thus, early detection of MCI is strongly needed. Classical neuropsychological measures - underlying a categorical model of diagnosis - could be integrated with a dimensional assessment approach involving Virtual Reality (VR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). VR can be used to create highly ecologically controlled simulations resembling the daily life contexts in which patients' daily instrumental activities (IADL) usually take place. Clinicians can record patients' kinematics, particularly gait, while performing IADL (Digital Biomarkers). Then, Artificial Intelligence employs Machine Learning (ML) to analyze them in combination with clinical and neuropsychological data. This integrated computational approach would enable the creation of a predictive model to identify specific patterns of cognitive and motor impairment in MCI. Therefore, this new dimensional cognitive-behavioral assessment would reveal elderly people's neural alterations and impaired cognitive functions, typical of MCI and dementia, even in early stages for more time-sensitive interventions.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3087488456","numberInSourceReferences":43,"doi":"10.3389/FPSYT.2020.579934","title":"Implementing Remote Memory Clinics to Enhance Clinical Care During and After COVID-19","authors":[{"id":"A4343082725","orcid":null,"LN":"Owens","FN":"Andrew","affil":"King's College London (GB)"},{"id":"A4356105904","orcid":null,"LN":"Ballard","FN":"Clive","affil":"University of Exeter (GB)"},{"id":"A2107728731","orcid":null,"LN":"Beigi","FN":"Mazda","affil":"South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (GB)"},{"id":"A2570512625","orcid":"0000-0002-7171-5391","LN":"Kalafatis","FN":"Chris","affil":"King's College London (GB), South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (GB)"},{"id":"A4357280451","orcid":null,"LN":"Brooker","FN":"Helen","affil":"University of Exeter (GB), Ecog Pro Ltd, Bristol, United Kingdom"},{"id":"A4356100392","orcid":null,"LN":"Lavelle","FN":"Grace","affil":"King's College London (GB)"},{"id":"A4332094358","orcid":null,"LN":"Brønnick","FN":"Kolbjørn","affil":"University of Stavanger (NO), Stavanger University Hospital (NO)"},{"id":"A2137326444","orcid":null,"LN":"Sauer","FN":"Justin","affil":"King's College London (GB), South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (GB)"},{"id":"A2497248699","orcid":null,"LN":"Boddington","FN":"Steve","affil":"South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (GB)"},{"id":"A4359415219","orcid":null,"LN":"Velayudhan","FN":"Latha","affil":"King's College London (GB)"},{"id":"A4357933564","orcid":null,"LN":"Aarsland","FN":"Dag","affil":"King's College London (GB), South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (GB), Stavanger University Hospital (NO)"}],"year":2020,"journal":"Frontiers in Psychiatry (Frontiers Media)","references":["W142855779","W1277966809","W1705284624","W1717038414","W1837130411","W1853705225","W1893058645","W1946310279","W1981404176","W1981430568","W1987922230","W1992227603","W1997167741","W2008546229","W2010243952","W2023128438","W2026097558","W2028713065","W2066595765","W2069411066","W2080171188","W2098853010","W2101122631","W2114327504","W2118050132","W2134891019","W2145847230","W2147081851","W2147176795","W2147342519","W2154855876","W2155054661","W2158567814","W2161769056","W2163632555","W2205216748","W2220182234","W2251818548","W2333574659","W2334262609","W2395197455","W2500662120","W2553827870","W2566554776","W2580484609","W2605277320","W2623521763","W2625027748","W2733673218","W2754480121","W2758494687","W2763200550","W2783644354","W2787183480","W2787588991","W2800798183","W2803176146","W2806998686","W2883959183","W2884702161","W2898731598","W2901641376","W2904206377","W2907272110","W2909733247","W2911417821","W2912143189","W2913987571","W2914407885","W2926483960","W2949263718","W2960798807","W2965472879","W2978367895","W2978680618","W2980318513","W2981610011","W2996990963","W3002049595","W3016538532","W3023885049","W3027994022","W3031869734","W3033023978","W3165656738","W4213231540","W4229644268","W4231588400","W4233433175","W4237638050","W4242539966"],"citationsCount":34,"abstract":"Social isolation is likely to be recommended for older adults even after COVID-19 restrictions are lifted, with ongoing reduced clinical contact suggested for this population. This has increased the need for remote memory clinics. Here we review the literature, current practices and guidelines on organising such remote memory clinics, focusing on assessment of cognition, function and other relevant measurements, proposing a novel pathway based on three levels of complexity: from simple telephone or video-based interviews and testing using available tests (Level 1), to digitized and validated methods based on standard pen-and-paper tests and scales (Level 2) and finally discuss the use of fully digitized cognitive batteries and remote measurement technologies (RMTs, Level 3). Utilising online cognitive testing can provide more accurate measures of cognitive status and RMTs also offer a ‘real-time’ window into functional status of the patient. Pros and cons of these strategies are discussed. Remotely collected data negates the need for frail patients or carers to commute to clinic and offers valuable insights into progression over time, as well as treatment responses to therapeutic interventions, providing a more realistic and contextualised environment for data-collection. Notwithstanding several challenges related to internet access, computer skills, limited evidence base and regulatory and data protection issues, digital biomarkers that can be collected remotely have significant potential for diagnosis and symptom management in older adults and we propose a framework and pathway for how technologies can be implemented to support the remote memory clinic. These platforms are also well-placed for administration of digital cognitive training and other interventions. The individual, societal and public/private costs of COVID-19 are high and will continue to rise for some time but the many challenges the pandemic has placed on memory services also provides an opportunity to embrace novel technologies and approaches. Remote memory clinics can be cost-saving and their financial, logistical, clinical and practical benefits have been highlighted by COVID-19, supporting their use to not only be maintained when social distancing legislation is lifted but to be devoted extra resources and attention to fully potentiate this valuable arm of clinical assessment and care.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3092460272","numberInSourceReferences":82,"doi":"10.14283/JFA.2020.51","title":"Intrinsic Capacitiy monitoring by digital biomarkers in Integrated Care for Older People (ICOPE)","authors":[{"id":"A2308061401","orcid":"0000-0003-2849-3057","LN":"Piau","FN":"Antoine","affil":"Hôpital de La Grave (FR), Université de Toulouse (FR), Inserm (FR), Médipole Garonne (FR)"},{"id":"A2926481639","orcid":null,"LN":"Steinmeyer","FN":"Zara","affil":"Médipole Garonne (FR)"},{"id":"A4360065719","orcid":null,"LN":"Cesari","FN":"Matteo","affil":"University of Milan (IT)"},{"id":"A4332844450","orcid":null,"LN":"Kornfeld","FN":"Judith","affil":"Oregon Health & Science University (US)"},{"id":"A1258151959","orcid":"0000-0002-4844-7122","LN":"Beattie","FN":"Zachary","affil":"Oregon Health & Science University (US)"},{"id":"A4359050033","orcid":null,"LN":"Kaye","FN":"Jeffrey","affil":"Oregon Health & Science University (US)"},{"id":"A4353624972","orcid":null,"LN":"Vellas","FN":"Bruno","affil":"Université de Toulouse (FR), Inserm (FR), Médipole Garonne (FR)"},{"id":"A4359933167","orcid":null,"LN":"Nourhashemi","FN":"Fati","affil":"Université de Toulouse (FR), Inserm (FR), Médipole Garonne (FR)"}],"year":2020,"references":["W1590609081","W1894490285","W1967197730","W1972700290","W1997718099","W2033345578","W2059743726","W2139609044","W2161574907","W2166780580","W2171995598","W2587518505","W2592980563","W2600767421","W2739009153","W2759174152","W2759771684","W2766920067","W2791724957","W2800798183","W2803176146","W2885130446","W2895424277","W2910717946","W2918113908","W2953295902","W2954756813","W2975191354","W2979222282","W2979278189","W2995108855","W2995383185","W2999408826","W2999925032","W3010790670","W3013617123"],"citationsCount":11,"abstract":"The WHO action plan on aging expects to change current clinical practices by promoting a more personalized model of medicine.

Development and validation was conducted on a dataset of 1,833 presumed cognitively unimpaired and clinically diagnosed cognitively impaired individuals with varied neurological conditions. We benchmarked DCTclock against existing clock scoring systems and the Mini-Mental Status Examination, a widely-used but lengthier cognitive test, and showed that DCTclock offered a significant improvement in the detection of early cognitive impairment and the ability to characterize individuals along the Alzheimer's disease trajectory.

JTrack is an open-source (released under open-source Apache 2.0 licenses) platform for remote assessment of digital biomarkers (DB) in neurological, psychiatric and other indications. JTrack is developed and maintained to comply with security, privacy and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements. A wide range of anonymized measurements from motion-sensors, social and physical activities and geolocation information can be collected in either active or passive modes by using JTrack Android-based smartphone application. JTrack also provides an online study management dashboard to monitor data collection across studies. To facilitate scaling, reproducibility, data management and sharing we integrated DataLad as a data management infrastructure. Smartphone-based Digital Biomarker data may provide valuable insight into daily-life behaviour in health and disease. As illustrated using sample data, JTrack provides as an easy and reliable open-source solution for collection of such information.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3027994022","numberInSourceReferences":35,"doi":"10.1186/S12883-020-01736-X","title":"A self-administered, artificial intelligence (AI) platform for cognitive assessment in multiple sclerosis (MS)","authors":[{"id":"A4332744387","orcid":null,"LN":"Khaligh-Razavi","FN":"Seyed-Mahdi","affil":"Royan Institute (IR), Academic Center for Education, Culture and Research (IR)"},{"id":"A4353234458","orcid":null,"LN":"Sadeghi","FN":"Maryam","affil":"University of Tehran (IR)"},{"id":"A2913711792","orcid":null,"LN":"Khanbagi","FN":"Mahdiyeh","affil":"Royan Institute (IR), Academic Center for Education, Culture and Research (IR)"},{"id":"A2570512625","orcid":"0000-0002-7171-5391","LN":"Kalafatis","FN":"Chris","affil":"King's College London (GB), South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (GB)"},{"id":"A4359910802","orcid":null,"LN":"Nabavi","FN":"Seyed Mohammad","affil":"Royan Institute (IR), Academic Center for Education, Culture and Research (IR)"}],"year":2020,"journal":"BMC Neurology (Springer Science+Business Media)","references":["W1970062587","W1983753485","W1984280738","W1991493014","W1992985202","W2000908757","W2007948644","W2008879072","W2013999515","W2025070618","W2051599642","W2077226865","W2094738549","W2100192820","W2108193054","W2114110854","W2114977008","W2117406337","W2118975891","W2122545833","W2123544472","W2135566527","W2136028902","W2142577589","W2158156478","W2159590943","W2166746035","W2346504495","W2514396275","W2578514106","W2783605273","W2787894218","W2807181150","W2883286350","W2887970423","W2889466173","W2889497460","W2911974018","W2912183742","W2914396477","W2949225738","W2949263718","W2952686744","W2953263739"],"citationsCount":16,"abstract":"Abstract Background Cognitive impairment is common in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Accurate and repeatable measures of cognition have the potential to be used as markers of disease activity. Methods We developed a 5-min computerized test to measure cognitive dysfunction in patients with MS. The proposed test – named the Integrated Cognitive Assessment (ICA) – is self-administered and language-independent. Ninety-one MS patients and 83 healthy controls (HC) took part in Substudy 1, in which each participant took the ICA test and the Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS (BICAMS). We assessed ICA’s test-retest reliability, its correlation with BICAMS, its sensitivity to discriminate patients with MS from the HC group, and its accuracy in detecting cognitive dysfunction. In Substudy 2, we recruited 48 MS patients, 38 of which had received an 8-week physical and cognitive rehabilitation programme and 10 MS patients who did not. We examined the association between the level of serum neurofilament light (NfL) in these patients and their ICA scores and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) scores pre- and post-rehabilitation. Results The ICA demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability ( r = 0.94), with no learning bias, and showed a high level of convergent validity with BICAMS. The ICA was sensitive in discriminating the MS patients from the HC group, and demonstrated high accuracy (AUC = 95%) in discriminating cognitively normal from cognitively impaired participants. Additionally, we found a strong association ( r = − 0.79) between ICA score and the level of NfL in MS patients before and after rehabilitation. Conclusions The ICA has the potential to be used as a digital marker of cognitive impairment and to monitor response to therapeutic interventions. In comparison to standard cognitive tools for MS, the ICA is shorter in duration, does not show a learning bias, and is independent of language.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2942537220","numberInSourceReferences":20,"doi":"10.1186/S12967-019-1864-9","title":"Are innovation and new technologies in precision medicine paving a new era in patients centric care?","authors":[{"id":"A2146497717","orcid":"0000-0003-1276-8466","LN":"Seyhan","FN":"Attila A.","affil":"Brown University (US), Providence College (US), Temple University Health System (US), Fox Chase Cancer Center (US)"},{"id":"A4352139334","orcid":null,"LN":"Carini","FN":"Claudio","affil":"King's College London (GB)"}],"year":2019,"journal":"Journal of Translational Medicine (BioMed Central)","references":["W1516645853","W1562542742","W1799806109","W1968973935","W1970957432","W1974976948","W1975103375","W1981466349","W1986733915","W1989211393","W1991320836","W1994246752","W1996575556","W2001573429","W2003200844","W2008535165","W2014578307","W2019507419","W2019527035","W2023709564","W2025349319","W2043256370","W2047031939","W2063922001","W2069954171","W2083045667","W2089490126","W2096388504","W2100025044","W2119220491","W2119387367","W2120051475","W2123406596","W2127669794","W2135893370","W2136410628","W2140296089","W2149026511","W2162276444","W2168781986","W2214539934","W2346108121","W2413635030","W2507892764","W2508952393","W2554139951","W2578528809","W2592981312","W2598469579","W2617691667","W2619463261","W2686427836","W2746089242","W2760946358","W2787816121","W2791984906","W2794090318","W2811372437","W2900491651","W2901953250","W2907697690","W2909989567","W2911964244","W2950472298"],"citationsCount":114,"abstract":"Healthcare is undergoing a transformation, and it is imperative to leverage new technologies to generate new data and support the advent of precision medicine (PM). Recent scientific breakthroughs and technological advancements have improved our understanding of disease pathogenesis and changed the way we diagnose and treat disease leading to more precise, predictable and powerful health care that is customized for the individual patient. Genetic, genomics, and epigenetic alterations appear to be contributing to different diseases. Deep clinical phenotyping, combined with advanced molecular phenotypic profiling, enables the construction of causal network models in which a genomic region is proposed to influence the levels of transcripts, proteins, and metabolites. Phenotypic analysis bears great importance to elucidat the pathophysiology of networks at the molecular and cellular level. Digital biomarkers (BMs) can have several applications beyond clinical trials in diagnostics—to identify patients affected by a disease or to guide treatment. Digital BMs present a big opportunity to measure clinical endpoints in a remote, objective and unbiased manner. However, the use of “omics” technologies and large sample sizes have generated massive amounts of data sets, and their analyses have become a major bottleneck requiring sophisticated computational and statistical methods. With the wealth of information for different diseases and its link to intrinsic biology, the challenge is now to turn the multi-parametric taxonomic classification of a disease into better clinical decision-making by more precisely defining a disease. As a result, the big data revolution has provided an opportunity to apply artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms to this vast data set. The advancements in digital health opportunities have also arisen numerous questions and concerns on the future of healthcare practices in particular with what regards the reliability of AI diagnostic tools, the impact on clinical practice and vulnerability of algorithms. AI, machine learning algorithms, computational biology, and digital BMs will offer an opportunity to translate new data into actionable information thus, allowing earlier diagnosis and precise treatment options. A better understanding and cohesiveness of the different components of the knowledge network is a must to fully exploit the potential of it.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2961446758","numberInSourceReferences":25,"doi":"10.1016/J.SEMRADONC.2019.05.008","title":"Big Data From Small Devices: The Future of Smartphones in Oncology","authors":[{"id":"A4356188622","orcid":null,"LN":"Purswani","FN":"Juhi M.","affil":"New York University (US)"},{"id":"A4356805373","orcid":null,"LN":"Dicker","FN":"Adam P.","affil":"Kimmel Cancer Center (US), Thomas Jefferson University (US)"},{"id":"A4331938122","orcid":null,"LN":"Champ","FN":"Colin E.","affil":"Duke Medical Center (US)"},{"id":"A2957453823","orcid":null,"LN":"Cantor","FN":"Matt","affil":"Koneksa Health Inc., New York, NY."},{"id":"A4353776681","orcid":null,"LN":"Ohri","FN":"Nitin","affil":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine (US), Montefiore Medical Center (US)"}],"year":2019,"journal":"Seminars in Radiation Oncology (Elsevier BV)","references":["W1973490312","W1985936477","W2029042167","W2030554213","W2034665998","W2038439321","W2071753112","W2079027993","W2095086157","W2107915429","W2136310122","W2143062300","W2162812015","W2177958589","W2263724500","W2358115982","W2418506299","W2524125023","W2555430796","W2560207949","W2574768744","W2586341316","W2604093837","W2605856145","W2605901948","W2620925856","W2648025397","W2694759995","W2735136142","W2749121955","W2760916191","W2761225994","W2779593300","W2789240758","W2789293861","W2799372262","W2800521154","W2803161153","W2803375058","W2805638371","W2807845192","W2808816741","W2886010702","W2886578891","W2891348791","W2894759153","W2897589001","W2899502878","W2899736281","W2911406372","W2914574249"],"citationsCount":25,"abstract":"Technological advancements in the capabilities of modern smartphones offer tremendous potential to generate big data from small devices that could influence oncologists’ decision-making.

These technologies, however, have complex characteristics that present challenges to the assessment of their economic value. Previous studies have identified the challenges for personalized medicine and thus this work informs the more nascent topic of digital medicine.ObjectivesTo examine the methodological challenges and future opportunities for assessing the economic value of digital medicine, using personalized medicine as a comparison.MethodsWe focused specifically on digital biomarker technologies and multigene tests. We identified similarities in these technologies that can present challenges to economic evaluation: multiple results, results with different types of utilities, secondary findings, downstream impact (including on family members), and interactive effects.ResultsUsing a structured review, we found that there are few economic evaluations of digital biomarker technologies, with limited results.ConclusionsWe conclude that more evidence on the effectiveness of digital medicine will be needed but that the experiences with personalized medicine can inform what data will be needed and how such analyses can be conducted.

Objective This study aims to assess the methodological quality and quality of evidence from meta-analyses of digital biomarker–based interventions. Methods This study follows the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guideline for reporting systematic reviews, including original English publications of systematic reviews reporting meta-analyses of clinical outcomes (efficacy and safety endpoints) of digital biomarker–based interventions compared with alternative interventions without digital biomarkers. Imaging or other technologies that do not measure objective physiological or behavioral data were excluded from this study. A literature search of PubMed and the Cochrane Library was conducted, limited to 2019-2020. The quality of the methodology and evidence synthesis of the meta-analyses were assessed using AMSTAR-2 (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2) and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations), respectively. This study was funded by the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund of Hungary. Results A total of 25 studies with 91 reported outcomes were included in the final analysis; 1 (4%), 1 (4%), and 23 (92%) studies had high, low, and critically low methodologic quality, respectively. As many as 6 clinical outcomes (7%) had high-quality evidence and 80 outcomes (88%) had moderate-quality evidence; 5 outcomes (5%) were rated with a low level of certainty, mainly due to risk of bias (85/91, 93%), inconsistency (27/91, 30%), and imprecision (27/91, 30%). There is high-quality evidence of improvements in mortality, transplant risk, cardiac arrhythmia detection, and stroke incidence with cardiac devices, albeit with low reporting quality. High-quality reviews of pedometers reported moderate-quality evidence, including effects on physical activity and BMI. No reports with high-quality evidence and high methodological quality were found. Conclusions Researchers in this field should consider the AMSTAR-2 criteria and GRADE to produce high-quality studies in the future.

Critical to this transformation is the adoption of new technologies in the drug development process, catalyzing the transition from serendipity-driven to data-driven medicine. This paradigm shift comes with a need for both translation and precision, leading to a modern Translational Precision Medicine approach to drug discovery and development. Key components of Translational Precision Medicine are multi-omics profiling, digital biomarkers, model-based data integration, artificial intelligence , biomarker-guided trial designs and patient-centric companion diagnostics. In this review, we summarize and critically discuss the potential and challenges of Translational Precision Medicine from a cross-industry perspective.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4286213318","numberInSourceReferences":115,"doi":"10.3390/JCM11144191","title":"Digital Cognitive Biomarker for Mild Cognitive Impairments and Dementia: A Systematic Review","authors":[{"id":"A4359163760","orcid":null,"LN":"Ding","FN":"Zihan","affil":"Chinese University of Hong Kong (CN)"},{"id":"A2727251580","orcid":null,"LN":"Lee","FN":"Tsz-Lok","affil":"Chinese University of Hong Kong (CN)"},{"id":"A4354018268","orcid":null,"LN":"Chan","FN":"Agnes S.","affil":"Chinese University of Hong Kong (CN)"}],"year":2022,"journal":"Journal of Clinical Medicine (MDPI)","references":["W1481804282","W1486303545","W1536775843","W1971819054","W1981823724","W1988272933","W1991952617","W2000054198","W2017335254","W2020298616","W2023128438","W2029911859","W2030400570","W2034236657","W2036841482","W2039504908","W2052226124","W2063654543","W2066595765","W2067982633","W2071518933","W2079133792","W2082404113","W2093583310","W2095886544","W2105778736","W2108847225","W2110960800","W2115017507","W2115137151","W2118859390","W2126535525","W2137554996","W2138531981","W2140332491","W2145443292","W2149560742","W2152506794","W2159122349","W2161769056","W2164698391","W2226536649","W2266863819","W2409025302","W2507606273","W2549619879","W2582524520","W2592588044","W2594501962","W2594685815","W2606695625","W2610948095","W2699929765","W2736733157","W2737949662","W2739350124","W2778322739","W2790436009","W2792892160","W2794213781","W2794925800","W2808741319","W2811386340","W2891055238","W2892405997","W2911417821","W2911832650","W2917347002","W2920483777","W2923069016","W2942852966","W2954756813","W2967730738","W2968937071","W2978795816","W2990772382","W2999543595","W3011067510","W3012670297","W3017257590","W3023885049","W3048970135","W3084195925","W3087527309","W3099887644","W3108822321","W3112538355","W3113891591","W3118615836","W3127821820","W3134844217","W3138153082","W3139561899","W3173890921","W3174994854","W3196610754","W3207475493","W3208637768","W3209426885","W3212373741","W4200307969","W4200390259","W4206238295","W4220667742","W4220754116","W4221038730","W4225643160","W4281875823","W4282943525"],"citationsCount":4,"abstract":"The dementia population is increasing as the world's population is growing older. The current systematic review aims to identify digital cognitive biomarkers from computerized tests for detecting dementia and its risk state of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and to evaluate the diagnostic performance of digital cognitive biomarkers. A literature search was performed in three databases, and supplemented by a Google search for names of previously identified computerized tests. Computerized tests were categorized into five types, including memory tests, test batteries, other single/multiple cognitive tests, handwriting/drawing tests, and daily living tasks and serious games. Results showed that 78 studies were eligible. Around 90% of the included studies were rated as high quality based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Most of the digital cognitive biomarkers achieved comparable or even better diagnostic performance than traditional paper-and-pencil tests. Moderate to large group differences were consistently observed in cognitive outcomes related to memory and executive functions, as well as some novel outcomes measured by handwriting/drawing tests, daily living tasks, and serious games. These outcomes have the potential to be sensitive digital cognitive biomarkers for MCI and dementia. Therefore, digital cognitive biomarkers can be a sensitive and promising clinical tool for detecting MCI and dementia.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4308772003","numberInSourceReferences":102,"doi":"10.1177/20552076221136642","title":"Applications of deep learning methods in digital biomarker research using noninvasive sensing data","authors":[{"id":"A3188670322","orcid":"0000-0001-6812-9343","LN":"Jeong","FN":"Hoyeon","affil":"Yonsei University (KR)"},{"id":"A4308776013","orcid":null,"LN":"Jeong","FN":"Yong W","affil":"Yonsei University (KR)"},{"id":"A4308776014","orcid":null,"LN":"Park","FN":"Yeonjae","affil":"Yonsei University (KR)"},{"id":"A4308776015","orcid":null,"LN":"Kim","FN":"Kise","affil":"Korea University (KR)"},{"id":"A4308776016","orcid":null,"LN":"Park","FN":"Junghwan","affil":"MEZOO Co., Ltd., Wonju, Republic of Korea"},{"id":"A2145400435","orcid":"0000-0002-8792-9730","LN":"Kang","FN":"Dae Ryong","affil":"Yonsei University (KR)"}],"year":2022,"references":["W91108901","W1547891345","W1993482030","W2012485971","W2064675550","W2100495367","W2108598243","W2126598020","W2167696419","W2519804223","W2528158016","W2618530766","W2743916180","W2766736793","W2779593300","W2781276926","W2782905541","W2785419426","W2888241607","W2888637405","W2888673273","W2892160360","W2898242330","W2910721721","W2913097554","W2916326551","W2917347002","W2936437520","W2946165673","W2948149587","W2952320437","W2957344258","W2963531830","W2965520043","W2965907538","W2967197869","W2968807426","W2976945409","W2979746696","W2982468588","W2986026434","W2990170027","W2995404840","W2996219505","W2997849943","W2999749474","W3002553050","W3003551560","W3011727199","W3015620020","W3021953365","W3023600000","W3025901313","W3029947802","W3039861816","W3044940806","W3048477139","W3049431514","W3049758936","W3067609825","W3080165374","W3083885568","W3089557188","W3100788345","W3102932796","W3105238135","W3105986385","W3106597262","W3106617186","W3120002312","W3127657277","W3128301555","W3128435890","W3128764679","W3136582211","W3136679573","W3153530161","W3156215970"],"citationsCount":0,"abstract":"Introduction: Noninvasive digital biomarkers are critical elements in digital healthcare in terms of not only the ease of measurement but also their use of raw data. In recent years, deep learning methods have been put to use to analyze these diverse heterogeneous data; these methods include representation learning for feature extraction and supervised learning for the prediction of these biomarkers. Methods: We introduce clinical cases of digital biomarkers and various deep-learning methods applied according to each data type. In addition, deep learning methods for the integrated analysis of multidimensional heterogeneous data are introduced, and the utility of these data as an integrated digital biomarker is presented. The current status of digital biomarker research is examined by surveying research cases applied to various types of data as well as modeling methods. Results: We present a future research direction for using data from heterogeneous sources together by introducing deep learning methods for dimensionality reduction and mode integration from multimodal digital biomarker studies covering related domains. The integration of multimodality has led to advances in research through the improvement of performance and complementarity between modes. Discussion: The integrative digital biomarker will be more useful for research on diseases that require data from multiple sources to be treated together. Since delicate signals from patients are not missed and the interaction effects between signals are also considered, it will be helpful for immediate detection and more accurate prediction of symptoms.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4306748688","numberInSourceReferences":104,"doi":"10.3389/FDGTH.2022.913590","title":"Utilizing digital predictive biomarkers to identify Veteran suicide risk","authors":[{"id":"A4306749157","orcid":null,"LN":"Holmgren","FN":"Jackson G.","affil":"Rocky Vista University (US)"},{"id":"A4306749158","orcid":null,"LN":"Morrow","FN":"Adelene"},{"id":"A4306749159","orcid":null,"LN":"Coffee","FN":"Ali K."},{"id":"A4306749160","orcid":null,"LN":"Nahod","FN":"Paige M."},{"id":"A4306749161","orcid":null,"LN":"Santora","FN":"Samantha H."},{"id":"A4306749162","orcid":null,"LN":"Schwartz","FN":"Brian"},{"id":"A4306749163","orcid":null,"LN":"Stiegmann","FN":"Regan A."},{"id":"A4306749164","orcid":null,"LN":"Zanetti","FN":"Cole A."}],"year":2022,"journal":"Frontiers in digital health (Frontiers Media)","references":["W1965581817","W1989645918","W2003502731","W2006855982","W2025471465","W2041596340","W2096125444","W2121754713","W2132322340","W2148083007","W2239385095","W2338844064","W2510506923","W2530337893","W2611406986","W2725461439","W2739285693","W2752206110","W2768143983","W2789662105","W2790134514","W2797667447","W2808888082","W2810142167","W2810500942","W2901989762","W2912879272","W2917347002","W2936166334","W2938053512","W2944361236","W2950828914","W2963641566","W2964957198","W2985643512","W2986693902","W2995766927","W3016487077","W3018949043","W3025909083","W3041884622","W3094588291","W3097651466","W3109737646","W3115820685","W3121986904","W3126772981","W3130141120","W3134494703","W3173911214","W3179703998","W3186188291","W3186393163","W3197670203","W3210535740","W4200150286","W4206160619","W4293149647"],"citationsCount":0,"abstract":"Veteran suicide is one of the most complex and pressing health issues in the United States. According to the 2020 National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report, since 2018 an average of 17.2 Veterans died by suicide each day. Veteran suicide risk screening is currently limited to suicide hotlines, patient reporting, patient visits, and family or friend reporting. As a result of these limitations, innovative approaches in suicide screening are increasingly garnering attention. An essential feature of these innovative methods includes better incorporation of risk factors that might indicate higher risk for tracking suicidal ideation based on personal behavior. Digital technologies create a means through which measuring these risk factors more reliably, with higher fidelity, and more frequently throughout daily life is possible, with the capacity to identify potentially telling behavior patterns. In this review, digital predictive biomarkers are discussed as they pertain to suicide risk, such as sleep vital signs, sleep disturbance, sleep quality, and speech pattern recognition. Various digital predictive biomarkers are reviewed and evaluated as well as their potential utility in predicting and diagnosing Veteran suicidal ideation in real time. In the future, these digital biomarkers could be combined to generate further suicide screening for diagnosis and severity assessments, allowing healthcare providers and healthcare teams to intervene more optimally.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4281719097","numberInSourceReferences":120,"doi":"10.1007/S13167-022-00284-3","title":"Digital biomarkers and sex impacts in Alzheimer’s disease management — potential utility for innovative 3P medicine approach","authors":[{"id":"A4347614553","orcid":null,"LN":"Harms","FN":"Robbert L.","affil":"Altoida Inc."},{"id":"A4354978593","orcid":null,"LN":"Ferrari","FN":"Alberto U.","affil":"Women's Brain Project (CH)"},{"id":"A4350316153","orcid":null,"LN":"Meier","FN":"Irene B.","affil":"Chione GmbH, Binz, Switzerland"},{"id":"A3005590971","orcid":"0000-0002-7726-9847","LN":"Martinkova","FN":"Julie","affil":"Women's Brain Project (CH), University Hospital in Motol (CZ), Charles University (CZ)"},{"id":"A2483174281","orcid":"0000-0002-7327-2731","LN":"Santus","FN":"Enrico","affil":"Women's Brain Project (CH), Bayer (United States) (US)"},{"id":"A3025385932","orcid":"0000-0001-7510-1939","LN":"Marino","FN":"Nicola","affil":"Women's Brain Project (CH), University of Foggia (IT)"},{"id":"A2121958502","orcid":"0000-0003-4982-4716","LN":"Cirillo","FN":"Davide","affil":"Women's Brain Project (CH), Barcelona Supercomputing Center (ES)"},{"id":"A2709897408","orcid":null,"LN":"Mellino","FN":"Simona","affil":"Women's Brain Project (CH)"},{"id":"A4282564441","orcid":null,"LN":"Solarz","FN":"Silvina Catuara","affil":"Women's Brain Project (CH)"},{"id":"A1918810313","orcid":null,"LN":"Tarnanas","FN":"Ioannis","affil":"Altoida Inc., Houston, USA, Global Brain Health Institute, Dublin, Ireland"},{"id":"A4336061112","orcid":null,"LN":"Szoeke","FN":"Cassandra","affil":"Women's Brain Project (CH), University of Melbourne (AU)"},{"id":"A4355970342","orcid":null,"LN":"Hort","FN":"Jakub","affil":"University Hospital in Motol (CZ), Charles University (CZ), St. Anne´s University Hospital (CZ), University Hospital Brno (CZ)"},{"id":"A4355598741","orcid":null,"LN":"Valencia","FN":"Alfonso","affil":"Barcelona Supercomputing Center (ES), Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats (ES)"},{"id":"A4359952336","orcid":null,"LN":"Ferretti","FN":"Maria Teresa","affil":"Women's Brain Project (CH)"},{"id":"A4338865147","orcid":null,"LN":"Seixas","FN":"Azizi","affil":"University of Miami (US)"},{"id":"A2837656970","orcid":"0000-0002-4021-3129","LN":"Chadha","FN":"Antonella Santuccione","affil":"Women's Brain Project (CH)"}],"year":2022,"journal":"The Epma Journal (Springer Nature)","references":["W132006593","W1968114652","W1972978214","W1976161816","W1980541833","W2000417339","W2011195206","W2023128438","W2065338300","W2086350498","W2096963202","W2129497119","W2138531981","W2144481990","W2148092884","W2162941124","W2296815372","W2309687825","W2555730571","W2567505071","W2575460524","W2732150368","W2788175131","W2808696240","W2834941082","W2891997394","W2911832650","W2915118821","W2921623465","W2928002646","W2943907261","W2954019805","W2965970824","W2973037195","W2982468588","W2988277241","W2999615587","W3003551560","W3005930380","W3029881688","W3031172897","W3035623431","W3037604578","W3046275966","W3046739387","W3059668454","W3102476541","W3102932796","W3112300562","W3156027765","W3172159521","W3199293153","W3209426885","W3209588191"],"citationsCount":4,"abstract":"Abstract Digital biomarkers are defined as objective, quantifiable physiological and behavioral data that are collected and measured by means of digital devices. Their use has revolutionized clinical research by enabling high-frequency, longitudinal, and sensitive measurements. In the field of neurodegenerative diseases, an example of a digital biomarker-based technology is instrumental activities of daily living (iADL) digital medical application, a predictive biomarker of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) to dementia due to AD in individuals aged 55 + . Digital biomarkers show promise to transform clinical practice. Nevertheless, their use may be affected by variables such as demographics, genetics, and phenotype. Among these factors, sex is particularly important in Alzheimer’s, where men and women present with different symptoms and progression patterns that impact diagnosis. In this study, we explore sex differences in Altoida’s digital medical application in a sample of 568 subjects consisting of a clinical dataset (MCI and dementia due to AD) and a healthy population. We found that a biological sex-classifier, built on digital biomarker features captured using Altoida’s application, achieved a 75% ROC-AUC (receiver operating characteristic — area under curve) performance in predicting biological sex in healthy individuals, indicating significant differences in neurocognitive performance signatures between males and females. The performance dropped when we applied this classifier to more advanced stages on the AD continuum, including MCI and dementia, suggesting that sex differences might be disease-stage dependent. Our results indicate that neurocognitive performance signatures built on data from digital biomarker features are different between men and women. These results stress the need to integrate traditional approaches to dementia research with digital biomarker technologies and personalized medicine perspectives to achieve more precise predictive diagnostics, targeted prevention, and customized treatment of cognitive decline.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3217607181","numberInSourceReferences":70,"doi":"10.3389/FDGTH.2021.769823","title":"Reproducible Analysis Pipeline for Data Streams: Open-Source Software to Process Data Collected With Mobile Devices","authors":[{"id":"A4334346525","orcid":null,"LN":"Vega","FN":"Julio","affil":"University of Pittsburgh (US)"},{"id":"A4353496311","orcid":null,"LN":"Liu","FN":"Lianqing","affil":"University of Pittsburgh (US)"},{"id":"A3217534329","orcid":null,"LN":"Aguillera","FN":"Kwesi","affil":"University of Pittsburgh (US)"},{"id":"A4271309094","orcid":null,"LN":"Goel","FN":"Nikunj","affil":"University of Pittsburgh (US)"},{"id":"A3217471086","orcid":null,"LN":"Joshi","FN":"Echhit","affil":"University of Pittsburgh (US)"},{"id":"A3216896183","orcid":null,"LN":"Khandekar","FN":"Kirtiraj","affil":"University of Pittsburgh (US)"},{"id":"A3120542664","orcid":"0000-0001-5287-375X","LN":"Durica","FN":"Krina C","affil":"University of Pittsburgh (US)"},{"id":"A4352767017","orcid":null,"LN":"Kunta","FN":"Abhineeth Reddy","affil":"University of Pittsburgh (US)"},{"id":"A2100269163","orcid":"0000-0002-3318-7495","LN":"Low","FN":"Carissa A.","affil":"University of Pittsburgh (US)"}],"year":2021,"references":["W1894490285","W2078074240","W2110417468","W2222292469","W2297827560","W2347128633","W2516086211","W2520441859","W2592797645","W2599455989","W2624915721","W2781276926","W2787225861","W2792224659","W2793993424","W2794997027","W2795274753","W2802769465","W2805638371","W2810419619","W2886286848","W2891288076","W2912042303","W2929646074","W2941525596","W2953053278","W2954756813","W2962725972","W2964116189","W2972211076","W2977564546","W2981564501","W2984916588","W3021953365","W3022533257","W3029947802","W3042750741","W3043210715","W3088687258","W3126710441","W3138114698","W3150774312","W3163328251","W3184733222","W4234515473","W4249598641"],"citationsCount":6,"abstract":"Smartphone and wearable devices are widely used in behavioral and clinical research to collect longitudinal data that, along with ground truth data, are used to create models of human behavior. Mobile sensing researchers often program data processing and analysis code from scratch even though many research teams collect data from similar mobile sensors, platforms, and devices. This leads to significant inefficiency in not being able to replicate and build on others' work, inconsistency in quality of code and results, and lack of transparency when code is not shared alongside publications. We provide an overview of Reproducible Analysis Pipeline for Data Streams (RAPIDS), a reproducible pipeline to standardize the preprocessing, feature extraction, analysis, visualization, and reporting of data streams coming from mobile sensors. RAPIDS is formed by a group of R and Python scripts that are executed on top of reproducible virtual environments, orchestrated by a workflow management system, and organized following a consistent file structure for data science projects. We share open source, documented, extensible and tested code to preprocess, extract, and visualize behavioral features from data collected with any Android or iOS smartphone sensing app as well as Fitbit and Empatica wearable devices. RAPIDS allows researchers to process mobile sensor data in a rigorous and reproducible way. This saves time and effort during the data analysis phase of a project and facilitates sharing analysis workflows alongside publications.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3199202392","numberInSourceReferences":83,"doi":"10.2196/26608","title":"Exploring Test-Retest Reliability and Longitudinal Stability of Digital Biomarkers for Parkinson Disease in the m-Power Data Set: Cohort Study","authors":[{"id":"A3119102499","orcid":"0000-0002-5311-8286","LN":"Far","FN":"Mehran Sahandi"},{"id":"A236063756","orcid":"0000-0001-6363-2759","LN":"Eickhoff","FN":"Simon B."},{"id":"A3119238509","orcid":"0000-0001-7897-2537","LN":"Goñi","FN":"María"},{"id":"A2689337606","orcid":"0000-0003-0492-5644","LN":"Dukart","FN":"Juergen"}],"year":2021,"journal":"Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR Publications)","references":["W1841373314","W1929210519","W2018727741","W2033450646","W2041838348","W2054649557","W2063085086","W2067930422","W2069074795","W2072840417","W2079707802","W2084627109","W2095134828","W2104476198","W2110100294","W2112129946","W2115680948","W2122354382","W2138554597","W2145954079","W2153797245","W2157562389","W2158145372","W2296350496","W2343290709","W2504038606","W2572781833","W2604815664","W2612407727","W2759174152","W2761505665","W2783057859","W2793848612","W2801834301","W2809384842","W2894186025","W2898892933","W2912877598","W2921623465","W2963055278","W2965549584","W2971403564","W2974790665","W2996636445","W2999749474","W3006248243","W3025901313","W3027727417","W3105728206","W3121054808"],"citationsCount":9,"abstract":"Digital biomarkers (DB), as captured using sensors embedded in modern smart devices, are a promising technology for home-based sign and symptom monitoring in Parkinson disease (PD).Despite extensive application in recent studies, test-retest reliability and longitudinal stability of DB have not been well addressed in this context. We utilized the large-scale m-Power data set to establish the test-retest reliability and longitudinal stability of gait, balance, voice, and tapping tasks in an unsupervised and self-administered daily life setting in patients with PD and healthy controls (HC).Intraclass correlation coefficients were computed to estimate the test-retest reliability of features that also differentiate between patients with PD and healthy volunteers. In addition, we tested for longitudinal stability of DB measures in PD and HC, as well as for their sensitivity to PD medication effects.Among the features differing between PD and HC, only a few tapping and voice features had good to excellent test-retest reliabilities and medium to large effect sizes. All other features performed poorly in this respect. Only a few features were sensitive to medication effects. The longitudinal analyses revealed significant alterations over time across a variety of features and in particular for the tapping task.These results indicate the need for further development of more standardized, sensitive, and reliable DB for application in self-administered remote studies in patients with PD. Motivational, learning, and other confounders may cause variations in performance that need to be considered in DB longitudinal applications.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4318777643","numberInSourceReferences":123,"doi":"10.3390/BRAINSCI13020244","title":"A New Smart 2-Min Mobile Alerting Method for Mild Cognitive Impairment Due to Alzheimer’s Disease in the Community","authors":[{"id":"A4318809538","orcid":null,"LN":"Wang","FN":"Yujia","affil":"Zhejiang Chinese Medical University (CN)"},{"id":"A4318809539","orcid":null,"LN":"Chen","FN":"Tong","affil":"Chinese PLA General Hospital (CN)"},{"id":"A4318809540","orcid":null,"LN":"Wang","FN":"Chen","affil":"Zhejiang Chinese Medical University (CN)"},{"id":"A4359412390","orcid":null,"LN":"Ogihara","FN":"Atsushi","affil":"Zhejiang Chinese Medical University (CN), Waseda University (JP)"},{"id":"A4318809541","orcid":null,"LN":"Ma","FN":"Xiaowen","affil":"Zhejiang Chinese Medical University (CN)"},{"id":"A4318809542","orcid":null,"LN":"Huang","FN":"Shouqiang","affil":"Zhejiang Chinese Medical University (CN)"},{"id":"A4318809543","orcid":null,"LN":"Zhou","FN":"Siyu","affil":"Zhejiang Chinese Medical University (CN), Hangzhou Normal University (CN)"},{"id":"A4318809544","orcid":null,"LN":"Li","FN":"Shuwu","affil":"Zhejiang Chinese Medical University (CN)"},{"id":"A4318809545","orcid":null,"LN":"Liu","FN":"Jiakang","affil":"Zhejiang Chinese Medical University (CN)"},{"id":"A2992814185","orcid":null,"LN":"Li","FN":"Kai-Juan","affil":"Zhejiang Chinese Medical University (CN)"}],"year":2023,"journal":"Brain Sciences (MDPI)","references":["W37549670","W44270921","W1704947773","W1915842929","W1984106499","W1989052261","W2016937925","W2037862747","W2056993099","W2063110593","W2095458853","W2097830253","W2098579289","W2114631079","W2115017507","W2116572744","W2129497119","W2134711807","W2139279518","W2142950794","W2146561158","W2396141530","W2582524520","W2592742661","W2777516289","W2810517026","W2900756240","W2903099008","W2917347002","W2921623465","W2954756813","W2971598158","W3008391208","W3018431352","W3112323084","W3141907569","W3169630651","W3206699745","W3213490117","W4206774749","W4210975612","W4211036635","W4213459059","W4220831995","W4221038730","W4290744477","W4302028668","W4306410981"],"citationsCount":0,"abstract":"The early identification of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), in an early stage of AD can expand the AD warning window.

The hypothesis is proposed that there are neurobehavioral differences between normal cognitive (NC) elderly and AD patients with MCI reflected in digital biomarkers captured during SEP. According to this, we designed a new smart 2-min mobile alerting method for MCI due to AD, for community screening. Two digital biomarkers, total mission execution distance (METRtotal) and execution distance above the transverse obstacle (EDabove), were selected by step-up regression analysis. For the participants with more than 9 years of education, the alerting efficiency of the combination of the two digital biomarkers for MCI due to AD could reach 0.83. This method has the advantages of fast speed, high alerting efficiency, low cost and high intelligence and thus has a high application value for community screening in developing countries. It also provides a new intelligent alerting approach based on the human-computer interaction (HCI) paradigm for MCI due to AD in community screening.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4290615614","numberInSourceReferences":95,"doi":"10.1038/S41746-022-00656-Z","title":"A computational framework for discovering digital biomarkers of glycemic control","authors":[{"id":"A4295423377","orcid":null,"LN":"Bartolome","FN":"Abigail","affil":"Dartmouth College (US)"},{"id":"A2672409253","orcid":"0000-0001-6750-202X","LN":"Prioleau","FN":"Temiloluwa","affil":"Dartmouth College (US)"}],"year":2022,"references":["W172260869","W1492241266","W1517617524","W1968185060","W2031292911","W2061310674","W2082966849","W2098718453","W2108177741","W2109660469","W2134459161","W2160901128","W2164108143","W2174706414","W2227454888","W2400515917","W2417840983","W2528707782","W2547042582","W2607950918","W2766165088","W2770616601","W2789821761","W2792431097","W2792457233","W2795307842","W2796139277","W2805206708","W2807864508","W2888487581","W2889526011","W2889730139","W2891221355","W2895780939","W2897457722","W2907378463","W2909166675","W2913240367","W2915095068","W2917347002","W2933576053","W2947110395","W2948261890","W2948756736","W2952113171","W2968807426","W2971929662","W2993032844","W2999749474","W3014961299","W3020345984","W3021953365","W3031241991","W3049758936","W3081701602","W3091717979","W3098571227","W3106725715","W3118392672","W3120565934","W3123700022","W3126650624","W3127218785","W3135247164","W3164056298","W3195466285","W3200973767","W3209021985","W4236536742","W4238729664"],"citationsCount":1,"abstract":"Abstract Digital biomarkers can radically transform the standard of care for chronic conditions that are complex to manage.

With a combination of the top-ranked digital biomarkers, we achieved an average F1 score of 82.4% and 89.7% for classifying next-day glycemic control across two unique datasets.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4307273017","numberInSourceReferences":96,"doi":"10.3390/NU14214465","title":"Digital Biomarkers for Personalized Nutrition: Predicting Meal Moments and Interstitial Glucose with Non-Invasive, Wearable Technologies","authors":[{"id":"A4346786526","orcid":null,"LN":"Brink","FN":"Willem van den","affil":"Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (NL)"},{"id":"A4352330338","orcid":null,"LN":"Broek","FN":"Tim J. van den","affil":"Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (NL)"},{"id":"A4307273548","orcid":"0000-0001-5120-4239","LN":"Palmisano","FN":"Salvator","affil":"Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (NL)"},{"id":"A1914872794","orcid":"0000-0001-9612-657X","LN":"Wopereis","FN":"Suzan","affil":"Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (NL)"},{"id":"A2741096195","orcid":"0000-0002-1952-4774","LN":"Hoogh","FN":"Iris M de","affil":"Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (NL)"}],"year":2022,"journal":"Nutrients (MDPI)","references":["W1836187602","W1868211825","W1989879035","W2017554908","W2021203820","W2098857312","W2100271953","W2108453323","W2109660469","W2112776230","W2135205315","W2136840707","W2157097177","W2158822657","W2175465469","W2191573920","W2309974746","W2326746446","W2337858743","W2516593410","W2588601551","W2593812782","W2734770034","W2744696300","W2787820584","W2790501791","W2792431097","W2866915378","W2883478711","W2885541768","W2890552659","W2912759921","W2919203803","W2921623465","W2940871635","W2964879370","W2971073941","W2972777776","W2975114953","W2975391816","W2983229458","W2983507717","W2999615587","W3010627974","W3012339291","W3016443966","W3035408224","W3091297265","W3092849554","W3107642297","W3118502530","W3121986904","W3157020259","W3164056298","W3164568609","W3170855934","W3172358880","W3176117974","W3184688397","W4220978352","W4254687493"],"citationsCount":2,"abstract":"Digital health technologies may support the management and prevention of disease through personalized lifestyle interventions.

Twenty-four individuals collected continuous data from interstitial glucose monitoring, food logging, activity, and sleep tracking over 14 days. We demonstrated the use of continuous glucose monitoring and activity tracking in detecting eating moments with a prediction model showing an accuracy of 92.3% (87.2–96%) and 76.8% (74.3–81.2%) in the training and test datasets, respectively. Additionally, we showed the prediction of glucose peaks from food logging, activity tracking, and sleep monitoring with an overall mean absolute error of 0.32 (+/−0.04) mmol/L for the training data and 0.62 (+/−0.15) mmol/L for the test data. With Shapley additive explanations, the personal lifestyle elements important for predicting individual glucose peaks were identified, providing a basis for personalized lifestyle advice.

In MS, patients tend to become ill at a younger age and are so variable in terms of their disease course that there is no standard therapy. Therefore, it is necessary to enable a therapy that is as personalized as possible and to respond promptly to any changes, whether with noticeable symptoms or symptomless. Here, measurable parameters of biological processes can be used, which provide good information with regard to prognostic and diagnostic aspects, disease activity and response to therapy, so-called biomarkers Increasing digitalization and the availability of easy-to-use devices and technology also enable healthcare professionals to use a new class of digital biomarkers-digital health technologies-to explain, influence and/or predict health-related outcomes. The technology and devices from which these digital biomarkers stem are quite broad, and range from wearables that collect patients' activity during digitalized functional tests (e.g., the Multiple Sclerosis Performance Test, dual-tasking performance and speech) to digitalized diagnostic procedures (e.g., optical coherence tomography) and software-supported magnetic resonance imaging evaluation. These technologies offer a timesaving way to collect valuable data on a regular basis over a long period of time, not only once or twice a year during patients' routine visit at the clinic. Therefore, they lead to real-life data acquisition, closer patient monitoring and thus a patient dataset useful for precision medicine. Despite the great benefit of such increasing digitalization, for now, the path to implementing digital biomarkers is widely unknown or inconsistent. Challenges around validation, infrastructure, evidence generation, consistent data collection and analysis still persist. In this narrative review, we explore existing and future opportunities to capture clinical digital biomarkers in the care of people with MS, which may lead to a digital twin of the patient. To do this, we searched published papers for existing opportunities to capture clinical digital biomarkers for different functional systems in the context of MS, and also gathered perspectives on digital biomarkers under development or already existing as a research approach.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3048361440","numberInSourceReferences":47,"doi":"10.3748/WJG.V26.I29.4182","title":"Impact of mobile health and medical applications on clinical practice in gastroenterology","authors":[{"id":"A2981910081","orcid":"0000-0001-7098-9748","LN":"Kernebeck","FN":"Sven"},{"id":"A4357359764","orcid":null,"LN":"Busse","FN":"Theresa Sophie"},{"id":"A4334545772","orcid":null,"LN":"Böttcher","FN":"Maximilian"},{"id":"A4353966980","orcid":null,"LN":"Weitz","FN":"Jeffrey I."},{"id":"A4354911430","orcid":null,"LN":"Ehlers","FN":"Jan P."},{"id":"A2311451066","orcid":"0000-0003-0813-0136","LN":"Bork","FN":"Ulrich"}],"year":2020,"journal":"World Journal of Gastroenterology (Baishideng Publishing Group)","references":["W1508447533","W1569276499","W1836341502","W1965152904","W1967390644","W1968588668","W1980541833","W1986986493","W2007216121","W2030677354","W2033115336","W2034093676","W2046675378","W2089581066","W2101761001","W2105410691","W2109031474","W2120715704","W2130026454","W2148763706","W2150664025","W2258941992","W2273305007","W2274149374","W2301772915","W2363606877","W2403287428","W2527709935","W2530268835","W2530704880","W2562853022","W2563690698","W2568790418","W2569936787","W2582072331","W2587007203","W2592511022","W2600611927","W2604010316","W2605127753","W2640271157","W2656335897","W2664267452","W2734356183","W2735864852","W2740205666","W2744810221","W2745796204","W2762189095","W2765556623","W2765838289","W2766679907","W2778295058","W2783127432","W2783249319","W2784023774","W2784447709","W2796101516","W2796301980","W2800091779","W2801300431","W2802631713","W2803669305","W2805264206","W2806041005","W2809115223","W2884608892","W2886419256","W2887033287","W2889367588","W2893443580","W2895397895","W2896118777","W2897973573","W2902002452","W2904129081","W2909465590","W2910853489","W2917347002","W2921623465","W2927022403","W2930953725","W2944464025","W2946179647","W2946661638","W2947474623","W2948766192","W2949479300","W2954756813","W2955323905","W2956495581","W2963133337","W2965616035","W2969675489","W2975516305","W2978294504","W2978598104","W2980194287","W2985302801","W2989956556","W2998495007","W3003369869","W3004935188","W3013000795","W3013547516","W3015421112","W3017387078","W4231921028","W4249329670"],"citationsCount":28,"abstract":"Mobile health apps (MHAs) and medical apps (MAs) are becoming increasingly popular as digital interventions in a wide range of health-related applications in almost all sectors of healthcare.

Current tools to accurately evaluate cognitive impairment typically rely on a battery of questionnaires administered during clinical visits which is essential for the acquisition of repeated measurements in longitudinal studies. Previous studies have shown that the remote data collection of passively monitored daily interaction with personal digital devices can measure motor signs in the early stages of synucleinopathies, as well as facilitate longitudinal patient assessment in the real-world scenario with high patient compliance. This was achieved by the automatic discovery of patterns in the time series of keystroke dynamics, i.e. the time required to press and release keys, by machine learning algorithms. In this work, our hypothesis is that the typing patterns generated from user-device interaction may reflect relevant features of the effects of cognitive impairment caused by neurodegeneration. We use machine learning algorithms to estimate cognitive performance through the analysis of keystroke dynamic patterns that were extracted from mechanical and touchscreen keyboard use in a dataset of cognitively normal (n = 39, 51% male) and cognitively impaired subjects (n = 38, 60% male). These algorithms are trained and evaluated using a novel framework that integrates items from multiple neuropsychological and clinical scales into cognitive subdomains to generate a more holistic representation of multifaceted clinical signs. In our results, we see that these models based on typing input achieve moderate correlations with verbal memory, non-verbal memory and executive function subdomains [Spearman’s ρ between 0.54 (P &amp;lt; 0.001) and 0.42 (P &amp;lt; 0.001)] and a weak correlation with language/verbal skills [Spearman’s ρ 0.30 (P &amp;lt; 0.05)]. In addition, we observe a moderate correlation between our typing-based approach and the Total Montreal Cognitive Assessment score [Spearman’s ρ 0.48 (P &amp;lt; 0.001)]. Finally, we show that these machine learning models can perform better by using our subdomain framework that integrates the information from multiple neuropsychological scales as opposed to using the individual items that make up these scales. Our results support our hypothesis that typing patterns are able to reflect the effects of neurodegeneration in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease and that this new subdomain framework both helps the development of machine learning models and improves their interpretability.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4298123992","numberInSourceReferences":89,"doi":"10.1159/000526471","title":"Validation of the Remote Automated ki:e Speech Biomarker for Cognition in Mild Cognitive Impairment: Verification and Validation following DiME V3 Framework","authors":[{"id":"A4346494762","orcid":null,"LN":"Tröger","FN":"Johannes","affil":"a"},{"id":"A4299377709","orcid":null,"LN":"Baykara","FN":"Ebru"},{"id":"A4354520311","orcid":null,"LN":"Zhao","FN":"Jian"},{"id":"A4299377711","orcid":null,"LN":"Huurne","FN":"Daphne ter","affil":"Maastricht University (NL)"},{"id":"A4299377712","orcid":null,"LN":"Possemis","FN":"Nina","affil":"Maastricht University (NL)"},{"id":"A4299377713","orcid":null,"LN":"Mallick","FN":"Elisa"},{"id":"A4299377714","orcid":null,"LN":"Schäfer","FN":"Simona"},{"id":"A4299377715","orcid":null,"LN":"Schwed","FN":"Louisa"},{"id":"A3170290101","orcid":null,"LN":"Mina","FN":"Mario Magued"},{"id":"A4299377717","orcid":null,"LN":"Linz","FN":"Nicklas"},{"id":"A4354731092","orcid":null,"LN":"Ramakers","FN":"Inez H.G.B.","affil":"Maastricht University (NL)"},{"id":"A4299377719","orcid":null,"LN":"Ritchie","FN":"Craig","affil":"University of Edinburgh (GB)"}],"year":2022,"journal":"Digital biomarkers (Karger Publishers)","references":["W1835734472","W1847168837","W2008854521","W2027272551","W2058161128","W2108474398","W2115017507","W2136250824","W2148027524","W2148080316","W2167311298","W2209808747","W2732150368","W2803176146","W2806825704","W3009557458","W3016443966","W3093679575","W3101650868","W3108822321","W3117622607","W3137358529","W3184269374","W3209554038","W4221019627"],"citationsCount":1,"abstract":"Progressive cognitive decline is the cardinal behavioral symptom in most dementia-causing diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.

In this paper, we focus on one important use case, the long-term continuous monitoring of cognitive ability in older adults. Cognitive ability is a factor both for long-term monitoring of people living alone as well as a relevant outcome in clinical studies. In this work, we propose a new potential digital biomarker for cognitive abilities based on location eigenbehaviour obtained from contactless ambient sensors. Indoor location information obtained from passive infrared sensors is used to build a location matrix covering several weeks of measurement. Based on the eigenvectors of this matrix, the reconstruction error is calculated for various numbers of used eigenvectors. The reconstruction error in turn is used to predict cognitive ability scores collected at baseline, using linear regression. Additionally, classification of normal versus pathological cognition level is performed using a support-vector machine. Prediction performance is strong for high levels of cognitive ability but grows weaker for low levels of cognitive ability. Classification into normal and older adults with mild cognitive impairment, using age and the reconstruction error, shows high discriminative performance with an ROC AUC of 0.94. This is an improvement of 0.08 as compared with a classification with age only. Due to the unobtrusive method of measurement, this potential digital biomarker of cognitive ability can be obtained entirely unobtrusively-it does not impose any patient burden. In conclusion, the usage of the reconstruction error is a strong potential digital biomarker for binary classification and, to a lesser extent, for more detailed prediction of inter-individual differences in cognition.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4297872494","numberInSourceReferences":99,"doi":"10.3389/FPHAR.2022.916714","title":"Patient-led development of digital endpoints and the use of computer vision analysis in assessment of motor function in rare diseases","authors":[{"id":"A4298684584","orcid":null,"LN":"Ferrer-Mallol","FN":"Elisa","affil":"Aparito Ltd, Wrexham, United Kingdom"},{"id":"A4207678002","orcid":null,"LN":"Matthews","FN":"Clare"},{"id":"A4298684586","orcid":null,"LN":"Stoodley","FN":"Madeline"},{"id":"A4298684587","orcid":null,"LN":"Gaeta","FN":"Alessandra","affil":"Duchenne UK (GB)"},{"id":"A4298684588","orcid":null,"LN":"George","FN":"Elinor","affil":"Duchenne UK (GB)"},{"id":"A4298684589","orcid":null,"LN":"Reuben","FN":"Emily","affil":"Duchenne UK (GB)"},{"id":"A4298684590","orcid":null,"LN":"Johnson","FN":"Alex","affil":"Duchenne UK (GB)"},{"id":"A4298684591","orcid":null,"LN":"Davies","FN":"Elin Haf"}],"year":2022,"journal":"Frontiers in Pharmacology (Frontiers Media)","references":["W1496452409","W1672772017","W1951817210","W1980429541","W2043862760","W2088199742","W2167702182","W2169228155","W2530284901","W2756531641","W2942603982","W2956771187","W2962730651","W2968807426","W2984155431","W3013651044","W3029924594","W3094580235","W3109533980","W3127377019","W3130293205","W3131782536","W3136016905","W3147902819","W3164578773","W3191422445","W3193387296","W3194476247","W3210072454","W3210181204","W4200238116","W4205297756"],"citationsCount":2,"abstract":"Digital health technologies are transforming the way health outcomes are captured and measured. Digital biomarkers may provide more objective measurements than traditional approaches as they encompass continuous and longitudinal data collection and use of automated analysis for data interpretation. In addition, the use of digital health technology allows for home-based disease assessments, which in addition to reducing patient burden from on-site hospital visits, provides a more holistic picture of how the patient feels and functions in the real world. Tools that can robustly capture drug efficacy based on disease-specific outcomes that are meaningful to patients, are going to be key to the successful development of new treatments. This is particularly important for people living with rare and chronic complex conditions, where therapeutic options are limited and need to be developed using a patient-focused approach to achieve the biggest impact. Working in partnership with patient Organisation Duchenne UK, we co-developed a video-based approach, delivered through a new mobile health platform (DMD Home), to assess motor function in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a genetic, rare, muscular disease characterized by the progressive loss of muscle function and strength. Motor function tasks were selected to reflect the \"transfer stage\" of the disease, when patients are no longer able to walk independently but can stand and weight-bear to transfer. This stage is important for patients and families as it represents a significant milestone in the progression of DMD but it is not routinely captured and/or scored by standard DMD clinical and physiotherapy assessments. A total of 62 videos were submitted by eight out of eleven participants who onboarded the app and were analysed with pose estimation software (OpenPose) that led to the extraction of objective, quantitative measures, including time, pattern of movement trajectory, and smoothness and symmetry of movement. Computer vision analysis of video tasks to identify voluntary or compensatory movements within the transfer stage merits further investigation. Longitudinal studies to validate DMD home as a new methodology to predict progression to the non-ambulant stage will be pursued.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3122045979","numberInSourceReferences":26,"doi":"10.3389/FDGTH.2020.566595","title":"Wearable Based Calibration of Contactless In-home Motion Sensors for Physical Activity Monitoring in Community-Dwelling Older Adults","authors":[{"id":"A4333288103","orcid":null,"LN":"Schütz","FN":"Narayan","affil":"University of Bern (CH)"},{"id":"A4353811547","orcid":null,"LN":"Saner","FN":"Hugo","affil":"University of Bern (CH), Sechenov University (RU)"},{"id":"A2953638490","orcid":"0000-0002-1245-2931","LN":"Botros","FN":"Angela","affil":"University of Bern (CH)"},{"id":"A2762897099","orcid":"0000-0001-6577-200X","LN":"Buluschek","FN":"Philipp","affil":"DomoSafety S.A., Lausanne, Switzerland."},{"id":"A2443187763","orcid":"0000-0002-7641-8898","LN":"Urwyler","FN":"Prabitha","affil":"University Hospital of Bern (CH), University of Bern (CH)"},{"id":"A4359104680","orcid":null,"LN":"Müri","FN":"René M.","affil":"University Hospital of Bern (CH), University of Bern (CH)"},{"id":"A4343981350","orcid":null,"LN":"Nef","FN":"Tobias","affil":"University of Bern (CH)"}],"year":2021,"journal":"Frontiers in digital health (Frontiers Media)","references":["W1544359545","W1599571371","W1967197730","W1974704788","W2003302741","W2012768996","W2016762450","W2034878282","W2080139072","W2088203115","W2095342720","W2103940618","W2105499459","W2105655228","W2109270820","W2109784184","W2110803770","W2121807655","W2124609748","W2136019090","W2148836549","W2162772535","W2165469512","W2165758561","W2559820773","W2584016859","W2586341316","W2763127012","W2921623465","W2944361236","W2951645058","W2954539192","W2963022647","W2997591727","W3042932002"],"citationsCount":2,"abstract":"Passive infrared motion sensors are commonly used in telemonitoring applications to monitor older community-dwelling adults at risk.

In this work, we calibrate passive infrared motion sensors for in-home physical activity quantification with simultaneously acquired data from wearable accelerometers and use the data to find a suitable correlation between in-home and out-of-home physical activity. We use data from 20 community-dwelling older adults that were simultaneously provided with wireless passive infrared motion sensors in their homes, and a wearable accelerometer for at least 60 days. We applied multiple calibration algorithms and evaluated results based on several statistical and clinical metrics. We found that using even relatively small amounts of wearable based ground-truth data over 7-14 days, passive infrared based wireless sensor systems can be calibrated to give largely better estimates of older adults' daily physical activity. This increase in performance translates directly to stronger correlations of measured physical activity levels with a variety of age relevant health indicators and outcomes known to be associated with physical activity.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3197605447","numberInSourceReferences":51,"doi":"10.3389/FDGTH.2021.648190","title":"Discovering Composite Lifestyle Biomarkers With Artificial Intelligence From Clinical Studies to Enable Smart eHealth and Digital Therapeutic Services","authors":[{"id":"A16917464","orcid":"0000-0002-8841-6558","LN":"Kyriazakos","FN":"Sofoklis","affil":"Aarhus University (DK), Innovation Sprint Sprl, Belgium"},{"id":"A4336512821","orcid":null,"LN":"Pnevmatikakis","FN":"Aristodemos","affil":"Innovation Sprint Sprl, Brussels, Belgium."},{"id":"A4336813700","orcid":null,"LN":"Cesario","FN":"Alfredo","affil":"Innovation Sprint Sprl, Belgium"},{"id":"A3135695337","orcid":null,"LN":"Kostopoulou","FN":"Konstantina","affil":"Innovation Sprint Sprl, Brussels, Belgium."},{"id":"A1897243631","orcid":"0000-0002-5631-1575","LN":"Boldrini","FN":"Luca","affil":"Agostino Gemelli University Polyclinic (IT)"},{"id":"A4354755289","orcid":null,"LN":"Valentini","FN":"Vincenzo","affil":"Catholic University of the Sacred Heart (IT)"},{"id":"A4355257343","orcid":null,"LN":"Scambia","FN":"Giovanni","affil":"Agostino Gemelli University Polyclinic (IT)"}],"year":2021,"journal":"Frontiers in digital health (Frontiers Media)","references":["W1537544985","W2028323735","W2036887984","W2041657594","W2065491381","W2076063813","W2127781439","W2163647352","W2164552042","W2313879745","W2548666735","W2597385103","W2612301440","W2789140267","W2800973064","W2810465012","W2811475145","W2885447570","W2911964244","W2921518676","W2944492170","W2945267649","W2963957222","W2976350560","W2999615587","W3015565366","W3098949126","W4244686671"],"citationsCount":3,"abstract":"Discovery of biomarkers is a continuous activity of the research community in the clinical domain that recently shifted its focus toward digital, non-traditional biomarkers that often use physiological, psychological, social, and environmental data to derive an intermediate biomarker.

Wearable smart devices are potentially affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid, robust, lab-independent, and deliverable to the end user for point-of-care testing. The datasets derived from these devices are known as digital biomarkers. They represent a novel patient-centered approach to collecting longitudinal, context-derived health insights. Adding automated, analytical smartphone applications will enable their use in high-, middle-, and low-income countries. So far, digital biomarkers have been focused primarily on accelerometer data and heart rate due to well-established sensors originating from the consumer market. Novel emerging smart biosensors will detect biomarkers (or compounds) independent of a lab and noninvasively in sweat, saliva, and exhaled breath. These molecular digital biomarkers are a promising novel approach to reduce the burden from 2 major infectious diseases with urgent unmet needs: tuberculosis and infections with multidrug resistant pathogens. Active tuberculosis (aTbc) is one of the deadliest diseases from an infectious agent. However, a simple and reliable test for its detection is still missing. Furthermore, inappropriate antimicrobial use leads to the development of antimicrobial resistance, which is associated with high mortality and health care costs. From this perspective, we discuss the innovative approach of a noninvasive and lab-independent collection of novel biomarkers to detect aTbc, which at the same time may additionally serve as a scalable therapeutic drug monitoring approach for antibiotics. These molecular digital biomarkers are next-generation digital biomarkers and have the potential to shape the future of infectious diseases.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3167283109","numberInSourceReferences":84,"doi":"10.2196/24666","title":"Contactless Sleep Monitoring for Early Detection of Health Deteriorations in Community-Dwelling Older Adults: Exploratory Study","authors":[{"id":"A4333288103","orcid":null,"LN":"Schütz","FN":"Narayan"},{"id":"A4353811547","orcid":null,"LN":"Saner","FN":"Hugo"},{"id":"A2953638490","orcid":"0000-0002-1245-2931","LN":"Botros","FN":"Angela"},{"id":"A2954885597","orcid":"0000-0002-4457-0983","LN":"Pais","FN":"Bruno"},{"id":"A2233043922","orcid":"0000-0002-4452-8857","LN":"Santschi","FN":"Valérie"},{"id":"A2762897099","orcid":"0000-0001-6577-200X","LN":"Buluschek","FN":"Philipp"},{"id":"A4355630778","orcid":null,"LN":"Gatica-Perez","FN":"Daniel"},{"id":"A2443187763","orcid":"0000-0002-7641-8898","LN":"Urwyler","FN":"Prabitha"},{"id":"A4359104680","orcid":null,"LN":"Müri","FN":"René M."},{"id":"A4343981350","orcid":null,"LN":"Nef","FN":"Tobias"}],"year":2021,"journal":"Jmir mhealth and uhealth (JMIR Publications)","references":["W1037632257","W1668840622","W1740055240","W1974429432","W1983558726","W1992589697","W1993249717","W2003302741","W2016762450","W2017601521","W2090466892","W2091389808","W2110803770","W2112157145","W2120559736","W2123418885","W2143811165","W2147197409","W2148836549","W2167180156","W2345977868","W2473786944","W2524447566","W2559820773","W2561714104","W2586341316","W2643453066","W2774486220","W2789564334","W2907117825","W2921623465","W2944361236","W2977833371","W3012581557","W3042932002","W3081372190","W3090506614","W3122300232","W4205135756"],"citationsCount":12,"abstract":"Background Population aging is posing multiple social and economic challenges to society. One such challenge is the social and economic burden related to increased health care expenditure caused by early institutionalizations. The use of modern pervasive computing technology makes it possible to continuously monitor the health status of community-dwelling older adults at home. Early detection of health issues through these technologies may allow for reduced treatment costs and initiation of targeted preventive measures leading to better health outcomes. Sleep is a key factor when it comes to overall health and many health issues manifest themselves with associated sleep deteriorations. Sleep quality and sleep disorders such as sleep apnea syndrome have been extensively studied using various wearable devices at home or in the setting of sleep laboratories. However, little research has been conducted evaluating the potential of contactless and continuous sleep monitoring in detecting early signs of health problems in community-dwelling older adults. Objective In this work we aim to evaluate which contactlessly measurable sleep parameter is best suited to monitor perceived and actual health status changes in older adults. Methods We analyzed real-world longitudinal (up to 1 year) data from 37 community-dwelling older adults including more than 6000 nights of measured sleep. Sleep parameters were recorded by a pressure sensor placed beneath the mattress, and corresponding health status information was acquired through weekly questionnaires and reports by health care personnel. A total of 20 sleep parameters were analyzed, including common sleep metrics such as sleep efficiency, sleep onset delay, and sleep stages but also vital signs in the form of heart and breathing rate as well as movements in bed. Association with self-reported health, evaluated by EuroQol visual analog scale (EQ-VAS) ratings, were quantitatively evaluated using individual linear mixed-effects models. Translation to objective, real-world health incidents was investigated through manual retrospective case-by-case analysis. Results Using EQ-VAS rating based self-reported perceived health, we identified body movements in bed—measured by the number toss-and-turn events—as the most predictive sleep parameter (t score=–0.435, P value [adj]=&lt;.001). Case-by-case analysis further substantiated this finding, showing that increases in number of body movements could often be explained by reported health incidents. Real world incidents included heart failure, hypertension, abdominal tumor, seasonal flu, gastrointestinal problems, and urinary tract infection. Conclusions Our results suggest that nightly body movements in bed could potentially be a highly relevant as well as easy to interpret and derive digital biomarker to monitor a wide range of health deteriorations in older adults. As such, it could help in detecting health deteriorations early on and provide timelier, more personalized, and precise treatment options.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3114116910","numberInSourceReferences":62,"doi":"10.1002/ACN3.51236","title":"Design of a virtual longitudinal observational study in Parkinson’s disease (AT‐HOME PD)","authors":[{"id":"A4353397742","orcid":null,"LN":"Schneider","FN":"Ruth","affil":"University of Rochester Medical Center (US)"},{"id":"A4358236055","orcid":null,"LN":"Omberg","FN":"Larsson","affil":"Sage Bionetworks (US)"},{"id":"A4353622458","orcid":null,"LN":"Macklin","FN":"Eric A.","affil":"Harvard University (US)"},{"id":"A2795260389","orcid":null,"LN":"Daeschler","FN":"Margaret","affil":"Michael J.

The value of this approach has never been more evident than during the current COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to (1) establish and implement the infrastructure for longitudinal, virtual follow-up of clinical trial participants, (2) compare changes in smartphone-based assessments, online patient-reported outcomes, and remote expert assessments, and (3) explore novel digital markers of Parkinson’s disease disability and progression. Methods Participants from two recently completed phase III clinical trials of inosine and isradipine enrolled in Assessing Tele-Health Outcomes in Multiyear Extensions of Parkinson’s Disease trials (AT-HOME PD), a two-year virtual cohort study. After providing electronic informed consent, individuals complete annual video visits with a movement disorder specialist, smartphone-based assessments of motor function and socialization, and patient-reported outcomes online. Results From the two clinical trials, 226 individuals from 42 states in the United States and Canada enrolled. Of these, 181 (80%) have successfully downloaded the study’s smartphone application and 161 (71%) have completed patient-reported outcomes on the online platform. Interpretation It is feasible to conduct a large-scale, international virtual observational study following the completion of participation in brick-and-mortar clinical trials in Parkinson’s disease. This study, which brings research to participants, will compare established clinical endpoints with novel digital biomarkers and thereby inform the longitudinal follow-up of clinical trial participants and design of future clinical trials.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2970530803","numberInSourceReferences":18,"doi":"10.3389/FPHAR.2019.01122","title":"Information and Communication Technologies, a Promising Way to Support Pharmacotherapy for the Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia","authors":[{"id":"A2308061401","orcid":"0000-0003-2849-3057","LN":"Piau","FN":"Antoine","affil":"Médipole Garonne (FR), Oregon Health & Science University (US)"},{"id":"A4346607601","orcid":null,"LN":"Rumeau","FN":"Pierre","affil":"Médipole Garonne (FR)"},{"id":"A4360094822","orcid":null,"LN":"Nourhashemi","FN":"Fati","affil":"Médipole Garonne (FR), Inserm (FR)"},{"id":"A4355212963","orcid":null,"LN":"Martin","FN":"Maria Aldaya","affil":"Médipole Garonne (FR), Inserm (FR)"}],"year":2019,"journal":"Frontiers in Pharmacology (Frontiers Media)","references":["W1599571371","W1894490285","W1897974727","W1967197730","W1969192849","W1974470769","W2021809156","W2025945038","W2039772841","W2049158612","W2085187999","W2086657165","W2087538079","W2098255076","W2122003659","W2122959891","W2132592055","W2140928605","W2145672185","W2149888666","W2161574907","W2171995598","W2250965630","W2266461367","W2292019808","W2299501508","W2347128633","W2465033753","W2471841324","W2472371389","W2507326685","W2513897004","W2587196985","W2587504999","W2600767421","W2749718288","W2759174152","W2766554179","W2766920067","W2768859539","W2782390287","W2783599545","W2788290998","W2789662105","W2789970442","W2794989647","W2799922879","W2809588714","W2885149803","W2889386469","W2900033562","W2905116136","W2909268811","W2914275304","W2918113908","W2921965027","W2954756813","W4254975047"],"citationsCount":2,"abstract":"Health care systems face an expansion in the number of older individuals with a high prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases and related Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD). Healthcare providers are expected to develop innovative solutions to follow-up patients over time in the community. To date, we are unable to continuously and accurately monitor the nature, frequency, severity, progression and response to treatment of BPSD after the initial assessment. Technology could address this need and provide more sensitive, less biased and more ecologically valid measures. This could provide an opportunity to re-evaluate therapeutic strategies more quickly and, in some cases, to treat earlier, when symptoms are still amenable to therapeutic solutions. Several studies confirm the relationship between sensor-based data and cognition, mood and behavior. Most scientific work on mental health and technologies supports digital biomarkers, not so much as diagnostic tools but rather as monitoring tools, an area where unmet needs are significant. In addition to the implications for clinical care, these real-time measurements could lead to the discovery of new early biomarkers in mental health. Many also consider digital biomarkers as a way to better understand disease processes, and that they may contribute to more effective pharmaceutical research by (i) targeting the earliest stage, (ii) reducing sample size required, (iii) providing more objective measures of behaviors, (iv) allowing better monitoring of noncompliance, (v) and providing a better understanding of failures.

A large part of information is generated as real-world data (RWD). Data from electronic health records and digital biomarkers have the potential to reveal associations between the benefits and adverse events of medicines, establish new patient-stratification principles, expose unknown disease correlations, and inform on preventive measures. The impact for health care payers and providers, the biopharmaceutical industry, and governments is massive in terms of health outcomes, quality of care, and cost. However, a framework to assess the preliminary quality of RWD is missing, thus hindering the conduct of population-based observational studies to support regulatory decision-making and real-world evidence.To address the need to qualify RWD, we aimed to build a web application as a tool to translate characterization of some quality parameters of RWD into a metric and propose a standard framework for evaluating the quality of the RWD.The RWD-Cockpit systematically scores data sets based on proposed quality metrics and customizable variables chosen by the user. Sleep RWD generated de novo and publicly available data sets were used to validate the usability and applicability of the web application. The RWD quality score is based on the evaluation of 7 variables: manageability specifies access and publication status; complexity defines univariate, multivariate, and longitudinal data; sample size indicates the size of the sample or samples; privacy and liability stipulates privacy rules; accessibility specifies how the data set can be accessed and to what granularity; periodicity specifies how often the data set is updated; and standardization specifies whether the data set adheres to any specific technical or metadata standard. These variables are associated with several descriptors that define specific characteristics of the data set.To address the need to qualify RWD, we built the RWD-Cockpit web application, which proposes a framework and applies a common standard for a preliminary evaluation of RWD quality across data sets-molecular, phenotypical, and social-and proposes a standard that can be further personalized by the community retaining an internal standard. Applied to 2 different case studies-de novo-generated sleep data and publicly available data sets-the RWD-Cockpit could identify and provide researchers with variables that might increase quality.The results from the application of the framework of RWD metrics implemented in the RWD-Cockpit application suggests that multiple data sets can be preliminarily evaluated in terms of quality using the proposed metrics. The output scores-quality identifiers-provide a first quality assessment for the use of RWD. Although extensive challenges remain to be addressed to set RWD quality standards, our proposal can serve as an initial blueprint for community efforts in the characterization of RWD quality for regulated settings.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4225098391","numberInSourceReferences":98,"doi":"10.2196/34015","title":"Using Smartphone Sensor Paradata and Personalized Machine Learning Models to Infer Participants’ Well-being: Ecological Momentary Assessment","authors":[{"id":"A4359055750","orcid":null,"LN":"Hart","FN":"Alexander"},{"id":"A2147590426","orcid":"0000-0002-0027-9713","LN":"Reis","FN":"Dorota"},{"id":"A2793639928","orcid":"0000-0001-5740-1671","LN":"Prestele","FN":"Elisabeth"},{"id":"A4356634178","orcid":null,"LN":"Jacobson","FN":"Nicholas C."}],"year":2022,"journal":"Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR Publications)","references":["W1894490285","W1989356938","W1999866622","W2004976965","W2007447113","W2019180260","W2024312127","W2025334945","W2030677354","W2031201873","W2057907879","W2058718604","W2081156723","W2094181737","W2097360283","W2102581597","W2107583979","W2115240023","W2121044470","W2137100320","W2152423878","W2155002669","W2158435081","W2172273046","W2321609854","W2519132385","W2520441859","W2559181347","W2570738295","W2595557058","W2745140364","W2747071229","W2765227437","W2767105331","W2785702436","W2890085824","W2898459803","W2901209857","W2907787119","W2911964244","W2937803535","W2944339144","W2980916577","W2993886326","W3014713228","W3029721994","W3031345912","W3037651932","W3043210715","W3047235302","W3047346431","W3085273257","W3092337196","W3094704548","W3108151321","W3167615994","W3174993171","W4294541781"],"citationsCount":4,"abstract":"Background Sensors embedded in smartphones allow for the passive momentary quantification of people’s states in the context of their daily lives in real time. Such data could be useful for alleviating the burden of ecological momentary assessments and increasing utility in clinical assessments. Despite existing research on using passive sensor data to assess participants’ moment-to-moment states and activity levels, only limited research has investigated temporally linking sensor assessment and self-reported assessment to further integrate the 2 methodologies. Objective We investigated whether sparse movement-related sensor data can be used to train machine learning models that are able to infer states of individuals’ work-related rumination, fatigue, mood, arousal, life engagement, and sleep quality. Sensor data were only collected while the participants filled out the questionnaires on their smartphones. Methods We trained personalized machine learning models on data from employees (N=158) who participated in a 3-week ecological momentary assessment study. Results The results suggested that passive smartphone sensor data paired with personalized machine learning models can be used to infer individuals’ self-reported states at later measurement occasions. The mean R2 was approximately 0.31 (SD 0.29), and more than half of the participants (119/158, 75.3%) had an R2 of ≥0.18. Accuracy was only slightly attenuated compared with earlier studies and ranged from 38.41% to 51.38%. Conclusions Personalized machine learning models and temporally linked passive sensing data have the capability to infer a sizable proportion of variance in individuals’ daily self-reported states. Further research is needed to investigate factors that affect the accuracy and reliability of the inference.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4283373748","numberInSourceReferences":101,"doi":"10.1186/S12888-022-04013-Y","title":"Exploring the digital footprint of depression: a PRISMA systematic literature review of the empirical evidence","authors":[{"id":"A3134011391","orcid":"0000-0002-1508-8637","LN":"Zarate","FN":"Daniel","affil":"Victoria University (AU)"},{"id":"A4357944363","orcid":null,"LN":"Stavropoulos","FN":"Vasileios","affil":"National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (GR), Victoria University (AU)"},{"id":"A2128775639","orcid":null,"LN":"Ball","FN":"Michelle","affil":"Victoria University (AU)"},{"id":"A4283560482","orcid":null,"LN":"Collier","FN":"Gabriel de Sena","affil":"Victoria University (AU)"},{"id":"A4356634178","orcid":null,"LN":"Jacobson","FN":"Nicholas C.","affil":"Dartmouth College (US)"}],"year":2022,"journal":"BMC Psychiatry (BioMed Central)","references":["W565833860","W587138941","W798366530","W1429918312","W1522850626","W1605743674","W1741920700","W1843517362","W1938632486","W1963413739","W1969028458","W1972989258","W1980462268","W1981738711","W1992358909","W2000053835","W2002043486","W2008445781","W2016953118","W2017284083","W2019131541","W2023143019","W2023193262","W2023687307","W2025390349","W2030226793","W2035963726","W2048799165","W2050014949","W2060235851","W2061378977","W2063033231","W2063689475","W2072364128","W2076050375","W2080678163","W2083671243","W2086316575","W2093973716","W2096556506","W2097431992","W2102376462","W2104695445","W2112467718","W2112778345","W2114912764","W2115459266","W2118826874","W2120660835","W2125934914","W2128119533","W2128224889","W2131823335","W2132322340","W2141674457","W2143123323","W2147085624","W2149264570","W2149819442","W2158282570","W2169188095","W2170810893","W2236024408","W2252191003","W2261684155","W2302902443","W2314717166","W2339529702","W2347128633","W2392412101","W2410279510","W2413209147","W2414336880","W2414738784","W2425373967","W2464564905","W2509963317","W2516066574","W2517641808","W2538010775","W2538477776","W2551395232","W2560433743","W2592472466","W2592797645","W2592965535","W2596241616","W2597924996","W2599641339","W2602628430","W2611292983","W2612306253","W2725741797","W2727509775","W2735715289","W2763978895","W2765424800","W2768282503","W2773601852","W2775819279","W2784245106","W2790777949","W2794073325","W2796138774","W2799342450","W2802769465","W2803739917","W2805638371","W2806174130","W2806957720","W2808053987","W2808489527","W2855659753","W2885763310","W2887892059","W2889620547","W2891207557","W2891378911","W2893564987","W2895848210","W2897992630","W2901581401","W2902786830","W2903846508","W2905222826","W2907157911","W2908509159","W2908785406","W2914573821","W2915095068","W2922417943","W2929646074","W2931975782","W2942522401","W2955082898","W2955382130","W2964001927","W2964581149","W2965378118","W2965472879","W2969961171","W2971416542","W2979591843","W2980148744","W2981182836","W2981263932","W2987725842","W2993625232","W2996627455","W3009112456","W3010330933","W3011288871","W3013118432","W3019443569","W3022135431","W3025200094","W3030102532","W3033293557","W3034207811","W3037651932","W3038086201","W3043096756","W3044261773","W3046043114","W3047024470","W3047733816","W3049188596","W3081276602","W3082796994","W3093605994","W3094634962","W3096853025","W3111758161","W3118262372","W3118674061","W3121900947","W3126710441","W3127924821","W3128435188","W3130545040","W3135402573","W3137452898","W3148406767","W3162184360","W4235675284","W4235772248","W4238935917","W4247665917"],"citationsCount":9,"abstract":"Abstract Background This PRISMA systematic literature review examined the use of digital data collection methods (including ecological momentary assessment [EMA], experience sampling method [ESM], digital biomarkers, passive sensing, mobile sensing, ambulatory assessment, and time-series analysis), emphasizing on digital phenotyping (DP) to study depression. DP is defined as the use of digital data to profile health information objectively. Aims Four distinct yet interrelated goals underpin this study: (a) to identify empirical research examining the use of DP to study depression; (b) to describe the different methods and technology employed; (c) to integrate the evidence regarding the efficacy of digital data in the examination, diagnosis, and monitoring of depression and (d) to clarify DP definitions and digital mental health records terminology. Results Overall, 118 studies were assessed as eligible. Considering the terms employed, “EMA”, “ESM”, and “DP” were the most predominant. A variety of DP data sources were reported, including voice, language, keyboard typing kinematics, mobile phone calls and texts, geocoded activity, actigraphy sensor-related recordings (i.e., steps, sleep, circadian rhythm), and self-reported apps’ information. Reviewed studies employed subjectively and objectively recorded digital data in combination with interviews and psychometric scales. Conclusions Findings suggest links between a person’s digital records and depression. Future research recommendations include (a) deriving consensus regarding the DP definition and (b) expanding the literature to consider a person’s broader contextual and developmental circumstances in relation to their digital data/records.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4296028936","numberInSourceReferences":103,"doi":"10.1016/J.DRUDIS.2022.103354","title":"Digital biomarkers for post-licensure safety monitoring","authors":[{"id":"A1825114265","orcid":"0000-0001-5631-1711","LN":"Garcia-Gancedo","FN":"Luis"},{"id":"A2781004837","orcid":"0000-0003-3151-3653","LN":"Bate","FN":"Andrew","affil":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (GB), New York University (US), Global Safety, GSK, Brentford, UK"}],"year":2022,"journal":"Drug Discovery Today (Elsevier BV)","references":["W1939080369","W2066641491","W2110034024","W2111819588","W2153349282","W2159666011","W2162793647","W2194999862","W2269807470","W2401233896","W2556202573","W2584594895","W2749442893","W2782921151","W2883029808","W2898181499","W2978735198","W2987985090","W2996894939","W2997630903","W3105070630","W3109533980","W3131446646","W3164718964","W4226369230"],"citationsCount":1,"abstract":"Post-licensure safety data form the cornerstone of safety surveillance.

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are often the source of clinical evidence, similar to conventional drugs or medical devices. However, novel approaches such as the use of real-world data or digital biomarkers are also utilized. This article aimed to review how DTx products have been clinically evaluated. Methods: DTx products approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as of 2020 were reviewed and products with sufficient published information were selected. Pivotal clinical trials were analyzed according to the elements of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guideline. Case reviews were presented for other clinical evaluation strategies, considering the small number of publications. Results: Most approved DTx products used RCTs for clinical evaluations. Similar to conventional RCTs, parallel-group designs with statistical hypothesis testing were adopted. However, DTx trials were often not blinded due to practical issues and involved various comparator groups. In addition, DTx products could be readily evaluated in home-based settings and delivered through the internet. Other evaluation approaches included retrospective analyses using insurance claims data or usage data, which enabled long-term evaluations of effectiveness. Digital biomarkers obtained from real-time and continuous log data were also used to improve the objectiveness of endpoints. Conclusions: RCTs accounted for the majority of DTx evaluations. The designs of DTx trials were comparable to those of drug or device trials, but blinding and comparator elements were often different. Furthermore, the use of real-world data and digital biomarkers are also being tried.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4281878916","numberInSourceReferences":110,"doi":"10.2196/36258","title":"Optimizing Social Support in Oncology with Digital Platforms","authors":[{"id":"A4281213135","orcid":null,"LN":"Katsaros","FN":"Dimos"},{"id":"A4344010369","orcid":null,"LN":"Hawthorne","FN":"James"},{"id":"A4358696300","orcid":null,"LN":"Patel","FN":"Jay"},{"id":"A4207629490","orcid":"0000-0002-4748-6787","LN":"Pothier","FN":"Kaitlin"},{"id":"A1822375682","orcid":"0000-0002-6914-0218","LN":"Aungst","FN":"Timothy Dy"},{"id":"A4341923766","orcid":null,"LN":"Franzese","FN":"Christopher J."}],"year":2022,"references":["W1807337682","W1983385105","W2003490123","W2003960894","W2008666216","W2012910682","W2027365236","W2028760763","W2038597076","W2056853237","W2059445965","W2069999752","W2074151142","W2082029312","W2084343441","W2092640239","W2097439493","W2100019263","W2103069250","W2105650349","W2105773669","W2106748311","W2124232192","W2131716113","W2147485520","W2273121121","W2299306621","W2312786640","W2315759938","W2329364420","W2336992339","W2357465843","W2596241616","W2776546543","W2790318238","W2800292783","W2809129970","W2896631915","W2913412051","W2915095068","W2915406322","W2921623465","W2928239061","W2966772620","W2979513009","W2980292304","W2980377652","W2984580300","W3001762024","W3008401017","W3048641349","W3119005666","W3121102591","W3128646645","W3137272384","W3189941411","W3191488274","W4322702780"],"citationsCount":1,"abstract":"Increased cancer prevalence and survival rates coupled with earlier patient discharges from hospitals have created a greater need for social support. Cancer care is both short term and long term, requiring acute treatments, treatments for remission, and long-term screenings and treatment regimens. Health care systems are already overwhelmed and often struggle to provide social support systems for everyone. Caregivers are limited in number, and even when they are available, they often lack necessary information, skills, or resources to meet the needs of patients with cancer. The act of caregiving presents various challenges, and caregivers themselves often need social support as well. Despite these needs, most social support programs are targeted toward patients alone. Given the prevalence of cancer and known needs of these patients and their caregivers, the ability to identify those who need social support is crucial. Further, the scalability and overall availability of social support programs is vital for successful patient care. This paper establishes the benefits of social support for both patients and caregivers coping with cancer treatments, explores innovative ways of identifying patients who may need social support using digital tools, and reviews potential advantages of digital social support programs.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4220788688","numberInSourceReferences":111,"doi":"10.2196/36762","title":"SciKit Digital Health: Python Package for Streamlined Wearable Inertial Sensor Data Processing","authors":[{"id":"A4222710242","orcid":"0000-0001-6992-9545","LN":"Adamowicz","FN":"Lukas"},{"id":"A2973630124","orcid":"0000-0003-3371-8935","LN":"Christakis","FN":"Yiorgos"},{"id":"A2982492806","orcid":"0000-0001-9954-7003","LN":"Czech","FN":"Matthew D."},{"id":"A3214516054","orcid":null,"LN":"Adamusiak","FN":"Tomasz"}],"year":2022,"journal":"Jmir mhealth and uhealth (JMIR Publications)","references":["W56462961","W117545607","W1856448812","W2032257930","W2044048366","W2050294282","W2066216522","W2088111259","W2096680959","W2118192112","W2145343602","W2148683313","W2171167427","W2180429985","W2329483624","W2349408014","W2513681033","W2552428245","W2752316606","W2780291132","W2789199860","W2895226216","W2918399910","W2938815817","W2945073425","W2952406719","W2978146057","W2993825645","W2995012825","W2996473362","W2999310244","W3042750741","W3090334753","W3099954668","W3133877378"],"citationsCount":2,"abstract":"Wearable inertial sensors are providing enhanced insight into patient mobility and health.

SKDH combines data ingestion, preprocessing, and data analysis methods geared toward modern data science workflows and streamlines the generation of digital endpoints in \"good practice\" environments by combining all the necessary data processing steps in a single pipeline. Our package simplifies the construction of new data processing pipelines and promotes reproducibility by following a convention over configuration approach, standardizing most settings on physiologically reasonable defaults in healthy adult populations or those with mild impairment. SKDH is open source, as well as free to use and extend under a permissive Massachusetts Institute of Technology license, and is available from GitHub (PfizerRD/scikit-digital-health), the Python Package Index, and the conda-forge channel of Anaconda.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3126200495","numberInSourceReferences":52,"doi":"10.1002/TRC2.12131","title":"Continuous gait monitoring discriminates community‐dwelling mild Alzheimer's disease from cognitively normal controls","authors":[{"id":"A4357891254","orcid":null,"LN":"Varma","FN":"Vijay","affil":"National Institutes of Health (US), National Institute on Aging (US)"},{"id":"A4344184722","orcid":null,"LN":"Ghosal","FN":"Rahul","affil":"Bloomberg (United States) (US)"},{"id":"A2763491718","orcid":null,"LN":"Hillel","FN":"Inbar","affil":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (IL)"},{"id":"A4349997343","orcid":null,"LN":"Volfson","FN":"Dmitri","affil":"Takeda (United States) (US)"},{"id":"A2617054560","orcid":"0000-0002-0392-3535","LN":"Weiss","FN":"Jordan","affil":"University of California, Berkeley (US)"},{"id":"A4353379394","orcid":null,"LN":"Urbanek","FN":"Jacek","affil":"Johns Hopkins Medicine (US), Johns Hopkins University (US)"},{"id":"A4353192127","orcid":null,"LN":"Hausdorff","FN":"Jeffrey M.","affil":"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (IL)"},{"id":"A4354207439","orcid":null,"LN":"Zipunnikov","FN":"Vadim","affil":"Bloomberg (United States) (US)"},{"id":"A2110511711","orcid":"0000-0002-8385-1091","LN":"Watts","FN":"Amber","affil":"University of Kansas (US)"}],"year":2021,"journal":"Alzheimer's & Dementia: Translational Research & Clinical Interventions (Elsevier BV)","references":["W1589848011","W1661600686","W1897575514","W1967333153","W1991952617","W1994021830","W1998204074","W2011546364","W2023937415","W2024321742","W2030482433","W2033427845","W2044038526","W2057105744","W2058838468","W2067581867","W2078756260","W2090840528","W2105096466","W2114084237","W2132524523","W2144070181","W2148724641","W2156220037","W2165631177","W2175915319","W2256375944","W2354144140","W2461788933","W2487770199","W2528353153","W2585485651","W2622756690","W2753945619","W2761022737","W2786725461","W2795761008","W2811088743","W2882991329","W2912300438","W2914029965","W2917347002","W2955310379","W2965097109","W2997049753","W3006252679","W4210987525","W4242103476"],"citationsCount":9,"abstract":"Few studies have explored whether gait measured continuously within a community setting can identify individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Although essential, some individuals face major challenges in forming and maintaining social relationships due to the experience of social anxiety. The burden of social anxiety can be reduced through accessible assessment that leads to treatment. However, socially anxious individuals who seek help face many barriers stemming from geography, fear, or disparities in access to systems of care. But recent research suggested digital behavioral markers as a way to deliver cheap and easily accessible digital assessment for social anxiety: As earlier work shows, players with social anxiety show similar behaviors in virtual worlds as in the physical world, including tending to walk farther around other avatars and standing farther away from other avatars. The characteristics of the movement behavior in-game can be harnessed for the development of digital behavioral markers for the assessment of social anxiety. In this paper, we investigate whether implicit as well as explicit digital behavioral markers, proposed by prior work, for social anxiety can be used for predicting the level of social anxiety. We show that both, explicit and implicit digital behavioral markers can be harnessed for the assessment. Our findings provide further insights about how game-based digital behavioral markers can be used for the assessment of social anxiety.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3123303323","numberInSourceReferences":76,"doi":"10.4103/JFMPC.JFMPC_1806_20","title":"Primordial prevention: The missing link in neurological care","authors":[{"id":"A4351585471","orcid":null,"LN":"Hussain","FN":"Masaraf"}],"year":2021,"references":["W1639193670","W1998668361","W1999533270","W2085245763","W2123828906","W2138099494","W2153827064","W2165480974","W2172034545","W2600244189","W2795343150","W2921623465","W3021054854","W3082170234"],"citationsCount":2,"abstract":"Stroke, and neurodegenerative diseases represents, a major and rapidly growing burden of mortality and morbidity.

In this context, this study presents a joint research activity that will be conducted within Virtual Health and Wellbeing Living Lab Infrastructure in the transitional care domain to test and validate the harmonized Living Lab procedures and infrastructures. The collection of data from various sources (information and communications technology and clinical and patient-reported outcome measures) demonstrated the capacity to assess risk and support decisions during care transitions, but there is no harmonized way of combining this information.This study primarily aims to evaluate the feasibility and benefit of collecting multichannel data across Living Labs on the topic of transitional care and to harmonize data processes and collection. In addition, the authors aim to investigate the collection and use of digital biomarkers and explore initial patterns in the data that demonstrate the potential to predict transition outcomes, such as readmissions and adverse events.The current research protocol presents a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study that will consist of three phases, running consecutively in multiple sites: a cocreation phase, a testing and simulation phase, and a transnational pilot phase. The cocreation phase aims to build a common understanding among different sites, investigate the differences in hospitalization discharge management among countries, and the willingness of different stakeholders to use technological solutions in the transitional care process. The testing and simulation phase aims to explore ways of integrating observation of a patient's clinical condition, patient involvement, and discharge education in transitional care. The objective of the simulation phase is to evaluate the feasibility and the barriers faced by health care professionals in assessing transition readiness.The cocreation phase will be completed by April 2022. The testing and simulation phase will begin in September 2022 and will partially overlap with the deployment of the transnational pilot phase that will start in the same month. The data collection of the transnational pilots will be finalized by the end of June 2023. Data processing is expected to be completed by March 2024. The results will consist of guidelines and implementation pathways for large-scale studies and an analysis for identifying initial patterns in the acquired data.The knowledge acquired through this research will lead to harmonized procedures and data collection for Living Labs that support transitions in care.PRR1-10.2196/34573.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2945073356","numberInSourceReferences":21,"doi":"10.1016/J.MATURITAS.2019.05.010","title":"Inertial wearables as pragmatic tools in dementia","authors":[{"id":"A4357138693","orcid":null,"LN":"Godfrey","FN":"Andrew","affil":"Northumbria University (GB)"},{"id":"A4345326982","orcid":null,"LN":"Brodie","FN":"MartinJ.","affil":"UNSW Sydney (AU), Neuroscience Research Australia (AU)"},{"id":"A4356800551","orcid":null,"LN":"Schooten","FN":"Kimberley S. van","affil":"UNSW Sydney (AU), Neuroscience Research Australia (AU)"},{"id":"A2230959556","orcid":"0000-0002-5768-0348","LN":"Nouredanesh","FN":"Mina","affil":"University of Waterloo (CA)"},{"id":"A4359323604","orcid":null,"LN":"Stuart","FN":"Samuel","affil":"Oregon Health & Science University (US)"},{"id":"A4356980624","orcid":null,"LN":"Robinson","FN":"Louise","affil":"Newcastle University (GB), Newcastle Hospitals - Campus for Ageing and Vitality (GB)"}],"year":2019,"journal":"Maturitas (Elsevier BV)","references":["W1222922404","W1524821538","W1903118654","W1904110412","W1966901439","W1967333153","W1994133638","W1996845679","W2032254925","W2044951073","W2062015265","W2091252836","W2093375256","W2101838247","W2107330430","W2111883921","W2114830474","W2115529939","W2121784101","W2124844940","W2128628418","W2146362558","W2148317675","W2149376145","W2151529239","W2156580802","W2156809737","W2164184994","W2203290533","W2213926659","W2232968682","W2294269162","W2320111079","W2354144140","W2402500880","W2409767563","W2467548672","W2474649994","W2529025236","W2557195412","W2563305050","W2563558448","W2567013021","W2578946531","W2584016859","W2585485651","W2586431453","W2588679294","W2593801033","W2594925199","W2607804943","W2726248338","W2736307756","W2739693283","W2767754816","W2774951267","W2786670909","W2786725461","W2788228271","W2791577102","W2795440516","W2800960276","W2803176146","W2809223261","W2809588714","W2882997960","W2884733027","W2885028865","W2892130897","W2917347002","W2917862264","W2945614313","W2954029672"],"citationsCount":16,"abstract":"Dementia is a critically important issue due to its wide impact on health services as well as its personal and societal costs. Limitations exist for current dementia protocols, and there are calls to introduce modern technology that facilitates the addition of digital biomarkers to routine clinical practice. Wearable technology (wearables) are nearly ubiquitous in everyday life, gathering discrete and continuous digital data on habitual activities, but their utility in modern medicine remains low. Due to advances in data analytics, wearables are now commonly discussed as pragmatic tools to aid the diagnosis and treatment of a range of neurological disorders. Inertial sensor-based wearables are one such technology; they offer a low-cost approach to quantify routine movements that are fundamental to normal activities of daily living, most notably postural control and gait. Here, we provide a narrative review of how wearables are providing useful postural control and gait data to facilitate the capture of digital markers to aid dementia research. We outline the history of wearables, from their humble beginnings to their current use beyond the clinic, and explore their integration into modern systems, as well as the ongoing standardisation and regulatory efforts to integrate their use in clinical trials.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2903606943","numberInSourceReferences":11,"doi":"10.1093/ALCALC/AGY086","title":"Maximum Time Between Tests: A Digital Biomarker to Detect Therapy Compliance and Assess Schedule Quality in Measurement-Based eHealth Systems for Alcohol Use Disorder","authors":[{"id":"A2789706121","orcid":null,"LN":"Zetterström","FN":"Andreas","affil":"Kontigo Care AB, Påvel Snickares Gränd 12, Uppsala, Sweden."},{"id":"A4332351382","orcid":null,"LN":"Hämäläinen","FN":"Markku","affil":"Kontigo Care AB, Påvel Snickares Gränd 12, Uppsala, Sweden."},{"id":"A2790124584","orcid":null,"LN":"Karlberg","FN":"Elin","affil":"Uppsala University Hospital (SE)"},{"id":"A2790250609","orcid":null,"LN":"Winkvist","FN":"Maria","affil":"Kontigo Care AB, Påvel Snickares Gränd 12, Uppsala, Sweden."},{"id":"A2106675129","orcid":null,"LN":"Söderquist","FN":"Marcus","affil":"Kontigo Care AB, Påvel Snickares Gränd 12, Uppsala, Sweden."},{"id":"A2793847584","orcid":null,"LN":"Öhagen","FN":"Patrik","affil":"Uppsala Clinical Research Center, Dag Hammarskjölds väg 14 B, Uppsala Science Park, Uppsala, Sweden."},{"id":"A2100032863","orcid":"0000-0003-0244-3561","LN":"Andersson","FN":"Karl","affil":"Uppsala University (SE)"},{"id":"A4337926199","orcid":null,"LN":"Nyberg","FN":"Fred","affil":"Uppsala University (SE)"}],"year":2018,"journal":"Alcohol and Alcoholism (Oxford University Press)","references":["W2056885389","W2117046315","W2145304188","W2593482105","W2789472156","W2806112435"],"citationsCount":5,"abstract":"To evaluate, in a breathalyzer-based eHealth system, whether the time-based digital biomarker 'maximum time between tests' (MTBT) brings valuable information on alcohol consumption patterns as confirmed by correlation with blood phosphatidyl ethanol (PEth), serum carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT) and timeline follow-back data.Data on 54 patients in follow-up for treatment of alcohol use disorder were analysed.The model of weekly averages of 24-log transformed MTBT adequately described timeline follow-back data (P < 0.0001, R = 0.27-0.38, n = 650).

Smart home sensors have been successfully deployed as digital biomarkers to monitor health conditions, yet they have not been used to assess symptoms important to opioid use and overdose risks.This study piloted smart home sensors and investigated their ability to accurately detect clinically pertinent symptoms indicative of opioid withdrawal or respiratory depression in adults prescribed methadone.Participants (n = 4; 3 completed) were adults with opioid use disorder exhibiting moderate levels of pain intensity, withdrawal symptoms, and sleep disturbance. Participants were invited to two 8-hour nighttime sleep opportunities to be recorded in a sleep research laboratory, using observed polysomnography and ambient smart home sensors attached to lab bedroom walls. Measures of feasibility included completeness of data captured. Accuracy was determined by comparing polysomnographic data of sleep/wake and respiratory status assessments with time and event sensor data.Smart home sensors captured overnight data on 48 out of 64 hours (75% completeness). Sensors detected sleep/wake patterns in alignment with observed sleep episodes captured by polysomnography 89.4% of the time. Apnea events (n = 118) were only detected with smart home sensors in two episodes where oxygen desaturations were less severe (>80%).Smart home technology could serve as a less invasive substitute for biologic monitoring for adults with pain, sleep disturbances, and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Supplemental sensors should be added to detect apnea events. Such innovations could provide a step forward in assessing overnight symptoms important to populations taking opioids.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4311670561","numberInSourceReferences":85,"doi":"10.1111/JGS.18181","title":"Wrist accelerometer temporal analysis as a prognostic tool for aged care residents: A sub‐study of the <scp>ReMInDAR</scp> trial","authors":[{"id":"A4358429619","orcid":null,"LN":"Andrade","FN":"André Queiroz de","affil":"University of South Australia (AU)"},{"id":"A2462063707","orcid":"0000-0003-4135-2523","LN":"Lim","FN":"Renly","affil":"University of South Australia (AU)"},{"id":"A2100102153","orcid":"0000-0002-7691-9289","LN":"Kelly","FN":"Thu-Lan","affil":"University of South Australia (AU)"},{"id":"A4311671108","orcid":null,"LN":"Parfitt","FN":"Gaynor","affil":"University of South Australia (AU)"},{"id":"A4311671109","orcid":null,"LN":"Pratt","FN":"Nicole","affil":"University of South Australia (AU)"},{"id":"A4311671110","orcid":null,"LN":"Roughead","FN":"Elizabeth E","affil":"University of South Australia (AU)"}],"year":2022,"journal":"Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (Wiley-Blackwell)","references":["W1527709995","W1865004367","W1983312980","W2007839079","W2011045259","W2015563524","W2025056766","W2031477171","W2084103512","W2088111259","W2109784184","W2110363849","W2122955643","W2137027807","W2143074485","W2154776725","W2165758561","W2176134801","W2181523240","W2221831393","W2381952344","W2424553553","W2527688620","W2750887674","W2769885059","W2805692471","W2898664241","W2945073425","W2971238440","W2978516582","W2978966359","W2982600858","W3019097219","W3091619687","W3104103000","W3110172541","W3116248292","W3173820950","W4211083897","W4238048136","W4292528167"],"citationsCount":0,"abstract":"Objective measures for screening, prioritizing, and planning care for frail individuals are essential for appropriate aged care provision. This study evaluates metrics derived from actigraphy measures (captured by wrist accelerometer) as a digital biomarker to identify frail individuals at risk of adverse outcomes, including death, hospitalization, and cognitive decline.This was a secondary study using data from a randomized controlled trial assessing the effectiveness of an ongoing pharmacist service in residential aged care facilities. Three metrics are studied and compared: the Frailty Index, the daily time spent in light time activity, and the temporal correlation of the actigraphy signal, measured by detrended fluctuation analysis. The association between actigraphy-derived metrics at baseline and adverse events within 12 months (death, cognitive decline, and hospitalizations) was assessed using logistic regression.Actigraphy records were available for 213 participants living in aged-care, median age of 85 years. Individuals with higher temporal correlation (activity is less random) were at lower risk of death (Standardized OR: 0.49; 95% CI 0.34, 0.7, p < 0.001) and hospitalization (Standardized OR: 0.57; 95% CI 0.42, 0.77, p < 0.001) in 12 months, but there was no difference in cognitive decline (Standardized OR: 1; 95% CI 0.74, 1.35, p = 0.98). The predictive model that included temporal correlation had an area under the curve of 0.70 (CI 0.60-0.80) for death and 0.64 (CI 0.54-0.72) for hospitalization.Temporal correlation of the actigraphy signal from aged care residents was strongly associated with death and hospitalization, but not cognitive decline.

To this end, we describe initial validation of remote self-administration of cognitive tests within a regulatorily compliant tablet-based platform.

Anomaly detection approaches have been widely applied in various domains, including remote health monitoring. However, current approaches are challenged by noisy, multivariate data and low generalizability.This study aims to develop an online, lightweight unsupervised learning-based approach to detect anomalies representing adverse health conditions using activity changes in people living with dementia. We demonstrated its effectiveness over state-of-the-art methods on a real-world data set of 9363 days collected from 15 participant households by the UK Dementia Research Institute between August 2019 and July 2021. Our approach was applied to household movement data to detect urinary tract infections (UTIs) and hospitalizations.We propose and evaluate a solution based on Contextual Matrix Profile (CMP), an exact, ultrafast distance-based anomaly detection algorithm. Using daily aggregated household movement data collected via passive infrared sensors, we generated CMPs for location-wise sensor counts, duration, and change in hourly movement patterns for each patient. We computed a normalized anomaly score in 2 ways: by combining univariate CMPs and by developing a multidimensional CMP. The performance of our method was evaluated relative to Angle-Based Outlier Detection, Copula-Based Outlier Detection, and Lightweight Online Detector of Anomalies. We used the multidimensional CMP to discover and present the important features associated with adverse health conditions in people living with dementia.The multidimensional CMP yielded, on average, 84.3% recall with 32.1 alerts, or a 5.1% alert rate, offering the best balance of recall and relative precision compared with Copula-Based and Angle-Based Outlier Detection and Lightweight Online Detector of Anomalies when evaluated for UTI and hospitalization. Midnight to 6 AM bathroom activity was shown to be the most important cross-patient digital biomarker of anomalies indicative of UTI, contributing approximately 30% to the anomaly score. We also demonstrated how CMP-based anomaly scoring can be used for a cross-patient view of anomaly patterns.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-world study to adapt the CMP to continuous anomaly detection in a health care scenario. The CMP inherits the speed, accuracy, and simplicity of the Matrix Profile, providing configurability, the ability to denoise and detect patterns, and explainability to clinical practitioners. We addressed the need for anomaly scoring in multivariate time series health care data by developing the multidimensional CMP. With high sensitivity, a low alert rate, better overall performance than state-of-the-art methods, and the ability to discover digital biomarkers of anomalies, the CMP is a clinically meaningful unsupervised anomaly detection technique extensible to multimodal data for dementia and other health care scenarios.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4285263396","numberInSourceReferences":93,"doi":"10.14283/JPAD.2022.66","title":"Cognitive Digital Biomarkers from Automated Transcription of Spoken Language","authors":[{"id":"A4307340221","orcid":null,"LN":"Tavabi","FN":"N","affil":"University of Southern California (US)"},{"id":"A4307340222","orcid":null,"LN":"Stück","FN":"D","affil":"Evidation Health (United States) (US)"},{"id":"A4307340223","orcid":null,"LN":"Signorini","FN":"A","affil":"Evidation Health (United States) (US)"},{"id":"A4307340224","orcid":null,"LN":"Karjadi","FN":"C","affil":"Framingham Heart Study (US), Boston University (US)"},{"id":"A4307340225","orcid":null,"LN":"Hanai","FN":"T Al","affil":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology (US)"},{"id":"A4307340226","orcid":null,"LN":"Sandoval","FN":"M","affil":"Evidation Health (United States) (US)"},{"id":"A4307340227","orcid":null,"LN":"Lemke","FN":"C","affil":"Evidation Health (United States) (US)"},{"id":"A4307340228","orcid":null,"LN":"Glass","FN":"J","affil":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology (US)"},{"id":"A4307340229","orcid":null,"LN":"Hardy","FN":"S","affil":"Framingham Heart Study (US), Boston University (US)"},{"id":"A4307340230","orcid":null,"LN":"Lavallee","FN":"M","affil":"Boston University (US)"},{"id":"A4307340231","orcid":null,"LN":"Wasserman","FN":"B","affil":"Boston University (US)"},{"id":"A4307340232","orcid":null,"LN":"Ang","FN":"T F A","affil":"Framingham Heart Study (US), Boston University (US)"},{"id":"A4307340233","orcid":null,"LN":"Nowak","FN":"C M","affil":"Boston University (US)"},{"id":"A4307340234","orcid":null,"LN":"Kainkaryam","FN":"R","affil":"Evidation Health (United States) (US)"},{"id":"A4307340235","orcid":null,"LN":"Foschini","FN":"L","affil":"Evidation Health (United States) (US)"},{"id":"A4307340236","orcid":null,"LN":"Au","FN":"R","affil":"Framingham Heart Study (US), Boston University (US), Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (US)"}],"year":2022,"references":[],"citationsCount":2,"abstract":"Although patients with Alzheimer’s disease and other cognitive-related neurodegenerative disorders may benefit from early detection, development of a reliable diagnostic test has remained elusive.

The use of voice-based digital biomarkers derived from automated processing methods, combined with standard patient screening, might constitute a scalable way to enable early detection of dementia.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4284969185","numberInSourceReferences":94,"doi":"10.1016/J.JSS.2022.06.023","title":"Objective Measurement of Learners’ Cognitive Load During Simulation-Based Trauma Team Training: A Pilot Study","authors":[{"id":"A4338676067","orcid":null,"LN":"Park","FN":"Sandra Hyunsoo"},{"id":"A2309316306","orcid":"0000-0003-1501-6956","LN":"Goldberg","FN":"Scott A"},{"id":"A4285371229","orcid":null,"LN":"Al-Ballaa","FN":"Abdulrahman"},{"id":"A3166072207","orcid":"0000-0001-5634-1531","LN":"Tayeb","FN":"Baraa O"},{"id":"A4285371231","orcid":null,"LN":"Basurrah","FN":"Mohammed"},{"id":"A2552736338","orcid":"0000-0001-5527-5405","LN":"Abahuje","FN":"Egide"},{"id":"A4285371233","orcid":null,"LN":"Miccile","FN":"Chrisitian"},{"id":"A236918625","orcid":null,"LN":"Pozner","FN":"Charles N."},{"id":"A4347097196","orcid":null,"LN":"Yule","FN":"Steven"},{"id":"A4345760418","orcid":null,"LN":"Dias","FN":"Roger D."}],"year":2022,"journal":"Journal of Surgical Research (Elsevier BV)","references":["W567356153","W1503009069","W1557433409","W1795004830","W1972200139","W1982798168","W2003764707","W2010007906","W2012216847","W2026699230","W2055828899","W2059920500","W2080044950","W2084653151","W2087009677","W2114309687","W2119255433","W2130678510","W2133589238","W2138247586","W2145114078","W2153147191","W2154997129","W2157289187","W2176694872","W2210949426","W2278992398","W2323980803","W2416222519","W2462630643","W2470746831","W2772431524","W2793138952","W2905209797","W2908306959","W2938169034","W2966851358","W2979875836","W3036893978","W3102568812","W3175404036","W3199395343"],"citationsCount":1,"abstract":"Literature has shown cognitive overload which can negatively impact learning and clinical performance in surgery. We investigated learners' cognitive load during simulation-based trauma team training using an objective digital biomarker.A cross-sectional study was carried out in a simulation center where a 3-h simulation-based interprofessional trauma team training program was conducted. A session included three scenarios each followed by a debriefing session. One scenario involved multiple patients. Learners wore a heart rate sensor that detects interbeat intervals in real-time. Low-frequency/high-frequency (LF/HF) ratio was used as a validated proxy for cognitive load. Learners' LF/HF ratio was tracked through different phases of simulation.Ten subjects participated in 12 simulations. LF/HF ratios during scenario versus debriefing were compared for each simulation. These were 3.75 versus 2.40, P < 0.001 for scenario 1; 4.18 versus 2.77, P < 0.001 for scenario 2; and 4.79 versus 2.68, P < 0.001 for scenario 3. Compared to single-patient scenarios, multiple-patient scenarios posed a higher cognitive load, with LF/HF ratios of 3.88 and 4.79, P < 0.001, respectively.LF/HF ratio, a proxy for cognitive load, was increased during all three scenarios compared to debriefings and reached the highest levels in a multiple-patient scenario. Using heart rate variability as an objective marker of cognitive load is feasible and this metric is able to detect cognitive load fluctuations during different simulation phases and varying scenario difficulties.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4214825345","numberInSourceReferences":100,"doi":"10.1192/BJO.2022.28","title":"A call for open data to develop mental health digital biomarkers","authors":[{"id":"A4349029626","orcid":null,"LN":"Adler","FN":"Daniel S.","affil":"Cornell Tech, USA"},{"id":"A4354979514","orcid":null,"LN":"Wang","FN":"Fei","affil":"Department of Population Health Sciences, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York, USA"},{"id":"A4357520487","orcid":null,"LN":"Mohr","FN":"David C.","affil":"Behavioral Tech (US), Northwestern University (US)"},{"id":"A4357687004","orcid":null,"LN":"Estrin","FN":"Deborah","affil":"Cornell Tech, USA"},{"id":"A2595705487","orcid":null,"LN":"Livesey","FN":"Cecilia","affil":"University of Pennsylvania (US)"},{"id":"A4333190168","orcid":null,"LN":"Choudhury","FN":"Tanzeem","affil":"Cornell Tech, USA"}],"year":2022,"journal":"British Journal of Psychiatry Open (Cambridge University Press)","references":["W2520441859","W2604699010","W2902802452","W2915095068","W2978761732","W3009577241","W3038416215","W3087590708","W3100779497","W3120799265","W3132495213","W3181625273","W3198144000"],"citationsCount":5,"abstract":"Digital biomarkers of mental health, created using data extracted from everyday technologies including smartphones, wearable devices, social media and computer interactions, have the opportunity to revolutionise mental health diagnosis and treatment by providing near-continuous unobtrusive and remote measures of behaviours associated with mental health symptoms.

Quantitative measures derived from digital technology could provide Digital Biomarkers (DMs) enabling a quantitative and continuous monitoring of disease symptoms, also outside clinics. This includes the possibility to continuously and sensitively monitor the response to treatment, hence opening the opportunity to adapt medication pathways quickly. In addition, DMs may in the future allow early diagnosis, stratification of patient subgroups and prediction of clinical outcomes. Thus, DMs could complement or in certain cases even replace classical examiner-based outcome measures and molecular biomarkers measured in cerebral spinal fluid, blood, urine, saliva, or other body liquids. Altogether, DMs could play a prominent role in the emerging field of precision medicine. However, realizing this vision requires dedicated research. First, advanced data analytical methods need to be developed and applied, which extract candidate DMs from raw signals. Second, these candidate DMs need to be validated by (a) showing their correlation to established clinical outcome measures, and (b) demonstrating their diagnostic and/or prognostic value compared to established biomarkers. These points again require the use of advanced data analytical methods, including machine learning. In addition, the arising ethical, legal and social questions associated with the collection and processing of sensitive patient data and the use of machine learning methods to analyze these data for better individualized treatment of the disease, must be considered thoroughly. Using Parkinson's Disease (PD) as a prime example of a complex multifactorial disorder, the purpose of this article is to critically review the current state of research regarding the use of DMs, discuss open challenges and highlight emerging new directions.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4309679265","numberInSourceReferences":114,"doi":"10.3233/ADR-220059","title":"Current and Future Trends in Biomarkers for the Early Detection of Alzheimer’s Disease in Asia: Expert Opinion","authors":[{"id":"A4360084193","orcid":null,"LN":"Kandiah","FN":"Nagaendran","affil":"Nanyang Technological University (SG)"},{"id":"A4309679948","orcid":null,"LN":"Choi","FN":"Seong Hye","affil":"Inha University (KR)"},{"id":"A4309679949","orcid":null,"LN":"Hu","FN":"Chaur-Jong","affil":"Taipei Medical University-Shuang Ho Hospital (TW)"},{"id":"A4309679950","orcid":null,"LN":"Ishii","FN":"Kenji","affil":"Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology (JP)"},{"id":"A4309679951","orcid":null,"LN":"Kasuga","FN":"Kensaku","affil":"Niigata University (JP)"},{"id":"A4309679952","orcid":null,"LN":"Mok","FN":"Vincent C.T.","affil":"Chinese University of Hong Kong (CN), Prince of Wales Hospital (CN)"}],"year":2022,"journal":"Journal of Alzheimer's disease reports (IOS Press)","references":["W1530786050","W1934117767","W1976949993","W2034248704","W2069121057","W2103346709","W2108097071","W2108216694","W2115106388","W2141470005","W2142367912","W2154790008","W2155149980","W2156446608","W2287427579","W2300744495","W2580678368","W2623521763","W2736307992","W2775139260","W2794390181","W2798054687","W2802655428","W2803176146","W2811510751","W2884982789","W2887293045","W2896430225","W2900137947","W2910313823","W2921224315","W2939789416","W2945980668","W2952677120","W2972136518","W2973037195","W2989237197","W2991594523","W3005173199","W3009441391","W3011856986","W3014779409","W3016877536","W3019122005","W3021998742","W3034479818","W3042402214","W3042681711","W3048288999","W3080931007","W3084319265","W3086380019","W3086778606","W3093129379","W3120639558","W3160236175","W3161255059","W3165538756","W3173455631","W3179841967","W3194048913","W3200640612"],"citationsCount":0,"abstract":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a substantial healthcare burden in the rapidly aging Asian population. Early diagnosis of AD, by means of biomarkers, can lead to interventions that might alter the course of the disease. The amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration (AT[N]) framework, which classifies biomarkers by their core pathophysiological features, is a biomarker measure of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Our current AD biomarker armamentarium, comprising neuroimaging biomarkers and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, while clinically useful, may be invasive and expensive and hence not readily available to patients. Several studies have also investigated the use of blood-based measures of established core markers for detection of AD, such as amyloid-β and phosphorylated tau. Furthermore, novel non-invasive peripheral biomarkers and digital biomarkers could potentially expand access to early AD diagnosis to patients in Asia. Despite the multiplicity of established and potential biomarkers in AD, a regional framework for their optimal use to guide early AD diagnosis remains lacking. A group of experts from five regions in Asia gathered at a meeting in March 2021 to review the current evidence on biomarkers in AD diagnosis and discuss best practice around their use, with the goal of developing practical guidance that can be implemented easily by clinicians in Asia to support the early diagnosis of AD. This article summarizes recent key evidence on AD biomarkers and consolidates the experts' insights into the current and future use of these biomarkers for the screening and early diagnosis of AD in Asia.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4281776900","numberInSourceReferences":117,"doi":"10.3390/JPM12060936","title":"Development of Digital Biomarkers of Mental Illness via Mobile Apps for Personalized Treatment and Diagnosis","authors":[{"id":"A2129811738","orcid":"0000-0002-4831-3781","LN":"Chen","FN":"I-Ming","affil":"National Taiwan University Hospital (TW), National Taiwan University (TW)"},{"id":"A2105806831","orcid":"0000-0003-4747-5313","LN":"Chen","FN":"Yiying","affil":"National Taiwan University Hospital (TW)"},{"id":"A4353231414","orcid":null,"LN":"Liao","FN":"Shih-Cheng","affil":"National Taiwan University Hospital (TW), National Taiwan University (TW)"},{"id":"A4366648306","orcid":"0000-0001-9393-3886","LN":"Lin","FN":"Yu-Hsuan","affil":"National Taiwan University Hospital (TW), National Taiwan University (TW), National Health Research Institutes (TW)"}],"year":2022,"journal":"Journal of Personalized Medicine (MDPI)","references":["W1522850626","W1553228604","W2062808044","W2064206310","W2098427813","W2102316523","W2103257619","W2117046315","W2130042179","W2141334117","W2148445422","W2155002669","W2347128633","W2436825778","W2559181347","W2560433743","W2580382119","W2588915324","W2606894917","W2795307842","W2889620547","W2897822383","W2901527259","W2905370981","W2907641345","W2921902116","W2944863334","W2967103819","W2996256038","W2998597072","W3000102200","W3033505960","W3107600047","W3203310594","W3212476155"],"citationsCount":3,"abstract":"The development of precision psychiatry is largely based on multi-module measurements from the molecular, cellular, and behavioral levels, which are integrated to assess neurocognitive performances and clinically observed psychopathology.

The pandemic highlighted the need for seismic shifts in care paradigms and technology with considerations related to the digital divide and health literacy for digital health interventions to reach full potential and improve health outcomes. We discuss advances in telemedicine, remote patient monitoring, and emerging wearable technologies. Despite the promise of digital health, we emphasise the importance of addressing its limitations, including interpretation challenges, accuracy of findings, and artificial intelligence-driven algorithms.

In their current form, the typical paper-pencil methods traditionally used to track disease progression are too coarse to capture the subtleties of clinical phenomena. For this reason, digital biomarkers that capture, for example, motor function, cognition, and behavior using apps, wearables, and tracking systems are becoming increasingly established. However, given the high prevalence of cognitive impairment in PD, digital cognitive biomarkers to predict mental progression are important in clinical practice. This pilot study aimed to identify those components of our digital version of the TMT (dTMT) that allow discrimination between PD patients with and without cognitive deficits. A total of 30 healthy control (age 66.3 ± 8.61) and 30 participants with PD (age 68.3 ± 9.66) performed the dTMT using a touch-sensitive tablet to capture enhanced performance metrics, such as the speed between and inside circles. The decomposition of cognitive abilities based on integrating additional variables in the dTMT revealed that the Parkinson’s disease group was significantly more sensitive to parameters of inhibitory control. In contrast, the mild cognitive impairment group was sensitive to parameters of cognitive flexibility and working memory. The dTMT allows objective, ecologically valid, and long-term cognitive and fine-motor performance tracking, suggesting its potential as a digital biomarker in neurodegenerative disorders.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4282024163","numberInSourceReferences":122,"doi":"10.1159/000525061","title":"Dorsal Finger Fold Recognition by Convolutional Neural Networks for the Detection and Monitoring of Joint Swelling in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis","authors":[{"id":"A4354008914","orcid":null,"LN":"Hügle","FN":"Thomas"},{"id":"A4282283647","orcid":null,"LN":"Caratsch","FN":"Leo"},{"id":"A4282283648","orcid":null,"LN":"Caorsi","FN":"Matteo"},{"id":"A4282283649","orcid":null,"LN":"Maglione","FN":"Jules"},{"id":"A4332739115","orcid":null,"LN":"Dan","FN":"Diana"},{"id":"A4357963312","orcid":null,"LN":"Dumusc","FN":"Alexandre"},{"id":"A4208091474","orcid":"0000-0002-4018-9325","LN":"BLANCHARD","FN":"Marc"},{"id":"A2771883610","orcid":null,"LN":"Kalweit","FN":"Gabriel"},{"id":"A3176778359","orcid":null,"LN":"Kalweit","FN":"Maria"}],"year":2022,"journal":"Digital biomarkers (Karger Publishers)","references":["W91108901","W2001950449","W2104669609","W2145517217","W3021222207","W3033807343","W3037691155","W3082120157","W3157537176","W3163185992","W3169363026","W4226337681"],"citationsCount":4,"abstract":"Digital biomarkers such as wearables are of increasing interest in monitoring rheumatic diseases, but they usually lack disease specificity. In this study, we apply convolutional neural networks (CNN) to real-world hand photographs in order to automatically detect, extract, and analyse dorsal finger fold lines as a correlate of proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint swelling in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Hand photographs of RA patients were taken by a smartphone camera in a standardized manner. Overall, 190 PIP joints were categorized as either swollen or not swollen based on clinical judgement and ultrasound. Images were automatically preprocessed by cropping PIP joints and extracting dorsal finger folds. Subsequently, metrical analysis of dorsal finger folds was performed, and a CNN was trained to classify the dorsal finger lines into swollen versus non-swollen joints. Representative horizontal finger folds were also quantified in a subset of patients before and after resolution of PIP swelling and in patients with disease flares. In swollen joints, the number of automatically extracted deep skinfold imprints was significantly reduced compared to non-swollen joints (1.3, SD 0.8 vs. 3.3, SD 0.49, p < 0.01). The joint diameter/deep skinfold length ratio was significantly higher in swollen (4.1, SD 1.4) versus non-swollen joints (2.1, SD 0.6, p < 0.01). The CNN model successfully differentiated swollen from non-swollen joints based on finger fold patterns with a validation accuracy of 0.84, a sensitivity of 88%, and a specificity of 75%. A heatmap of the original images obtained by an extraction algorithm confirmed finger folds as the region of interest for correct classification. After significant response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drug ± corticosteroid therapy, longitudinal metrical analysis of eight representative deep finger folds showed a decrease in the mean diameter/finger fold length (finger fold index, FFI) from 3.03 (SD 0.68) to 2.08 (SD 0.57). Conversely, the FFI increased in patients with disease flares. In conclusion, automated preprocessing and the application of CNN algorithms in combination with longitudinal metrical analysis of dorsal finger fold patterns extracted from real-world hand photos might serve as a digital biomarker in RA.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4293695087","numberInSourceReferences":124,"doi":"10.1007/S00415-022-11306-5","title":"Reliability and acceptance of dreaMS, a software application for people with multiple sclerosis: a feasibility study","authors":[{"id":"A3200069602","orcid":"0000-0001-6279-4158","LN":"Woelfle","FN":"Tim","affil":"University Hospital of Basel (CH), University of Basel (CH), Research Center for Clinical Neuroimmunology and Neuroscience Basel, Basel, Switzerland"},{"id":"A3201568883","orcid":null,"LN":"Pless","FN":"Silvan","affil":"University Hospital of Basel (CH), University of Basel (CH), Research Center for Clinical Neuroimmunology and Neuroscience Basel, Basel, Switzerland"},{"id":"A2316304625","orcid":"0000-0002-1742-8121","LN":"Reyes","FN":"Oscar","affil":"Healios AG, Basel, Switzerland"},{"id":"A4351512355","orcid":null,"LN":"Wiencierz","FN":"Andrea","affil":"University Hospital of Basel (CH), University of Basel (CH)"},{"id":"A2769935763","orcid":"0000-0002-0132-0909","LN":"Feinstein","FN":"Anthony","affil":"Sunnybrook Health Science Centre (CA), Health Sciences Centre (CA)"},{"id":"A4353995377","orcid":null,"LN":"Calabrese","FN":"Pasquale","affil":"University Hospital of Basel (CH), University of Basel (CH)"},{"id":"A2802283259","orcid":"0000-0002-3520-2791","LN":"Gugleta","FN":"K.","affil":"University Hospital of Basel (CH), University of Basel (CH)"},{"id":"A4355533324","orcid":null,"LN":"Kappos","FN":"Ludwig","affil":"Research Center for Clinical Neuroimmunology and Neuroscience Basel, Basel, Switzerland"},{"id":"A2293082905","orcid":"0000-0003-1100-2506","LN":"Lorscheider","FN":"Johannes","affil":"University Hospital of Basel (CH), University of Basel (CH), Research Center for Clinical Neuroimmunology and Neuroscience Basel, Basel, Switzerland"},{"id":"A298337938","orcid":"0000-0002-1315-4100","LN":"Naegelin","FN":"Yvonne","affil":"University Hospital of Basel (CH), University of Basel (CH), Research Center for Clinical Neuroimmunology and Neuroscience Basel, Basel, Switzerland"}],"year":2022,"journal":"Journal of Neurology (Springer Science+Business Media)","references":["W2033582154","W2063085086","W2093031267","W2112165124","W2114242035","W2126737632","W2150378783","W2159162402","W2191952236","W2326826867","W2588488142","W2589005373","W2777074421","W2887970423","W2909270098","W2992140481","W3006248243","W3008633936","W3135207484","W3153945493","W3160285689","W3165016634","W3180418879","W3201477013","W4283593609"],"citationsCount":2,"abstract":"There is an unmet need for reliable and sensitive measures for better monitoring people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) to detect disease progression early and adapt therapeutic measures accordingly.To assess reliability of extracted features and meaningfulness of 11 tests applied through a smartphone application (\"dreaMS\").PwMS (age 18-70 and EDSS ≤ 6.5) and matched healthy volunteers (HV) were asked to perform tests installed on their smartphone once or twice weekly for 5 weeks.

CRF is assessed by self-report or clinical observation, which may limit timely diagnosis and management. In this study, we examined the effect of CRF on mobility performance measured by a wearable pendant sensor. Methods This is a secondary analysis of a clinical trial evaluating the benefit of exercise in cancer survivors with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). CRF status was classified based on a Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) score ≤ 33. Among 28 patients (age = 65.7±9.8 years old, BMI = 26.9±4.1kg/m 2 , sex = 32.9%female) with database variables of interest, twenty-one subjects (75.9%) were classified as non-CRF. Mobility performance, including behavior (sedentary, light, and moderate to vigorous activity (MtV)), postures (sitting, standing, lying, and walking), and locomotion (e.g., steps, postural transitions) were measured using a validated pendant-sensor over 24-hours. Baseline psychosocial, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–General (FACT-G), Falls Efficacy Scale–International (FES-I), and motor-capacity assessments including gait (habitual speed, fast speed, and dual-task speed) and static balance were also performed. Results Both groups had similar baseline clinical and psychosocial characteristics, except for body-mass index (BMI), FACT-G, FACIT-F, and FES-I ( p &lt;0.050). The groups did not differ on motor-capacity. However, the majority of mobility performance parameters were different between groups with large to very large effect size, Cohen’s d ranging from 0.91 to 1.59. Among assessed mobility performance, the largest effect sizes were observed for sedentary-behavior ( d = 1.59, p = 0.006), light-activity ( d = 1.48, p = 0.009), and duration of sitting+lying ( d = 1.46, p = 0.016). The largest correlations between mobility performance and FACIT-F were observed for sitting+lying (rho = -0.67, p &lt;0.001) and the number of steps per day (rho = 0.60, p = 0.001). Conclusion The results of this study suggest that sensor-based mobility performance monitoring could be considered as a potential digital biomarker for CRF assessment. Future studies warrant evaluating utilization of mobility performance to track changes in CRF over time, response to CRF-related interventions, and earlier detection of CRF.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3176980366","numberInSourceReferences":56,"doi":"10.1038/S41746-021-00470-Z","title":"Using a Digital Neuro Signature to measure longitudinal individual-level change in Alzheimer’s disease: the Altoida large cohort study","authors":[{"id":"A4350316153","orcid":null,"LN":"Meier","FN":"Irene B.","affil":"Chione GmbH, Binz, Switzerland"},{"id":"A3176029665","orcid":null,"LN":"Buegler","FN":"Max","affil":"Altoida Inc., Houston, USA"},{"id":"A4347614553","orcid":null,"LN":"Harms","FN":"Robbert L.","affil":"Altoida Inc., Houston, USA"},{"id":"A4338865147","orcid":null,"LN":"Seixas","FN":"Azizi","affil":"New York University (US)"},{"id":"A4358707796","orcid":null,"LN":"Çöltekin","FN":"Arzu","affil":"University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland (CH)"},{"id":"A1918810313","orcid":null,"LN":"Tarnanas","FN":"Ioannis","affil":"Altoida Inc., Houston, USA, Global Brain Health Institute (US), Trinity College Dublin (IE), Ionian University (GR)"}],"year":2021,"journal":"npj digital medicine (Nature Portfolio)","references":["W644101671","W1847168837","W1975291371","W2004444009","W2025341113","W2034424435","W2039604956","W2041330307","W2045322533","W2055148230","W2067314736","W2067812668","W2068709126","W2094261818","W2096337635","W2123830992","W2125574115","W2136251033","W2145111120","W2156708654","W2158090607","W2165758561","W2209808747","W2334428983","W2790783365","W2798054687","W2950283932","W3126056747"],"citationsCount":19,"abstract":"Abstract Conventional neuropsychological assessments for Alzheimer’s disease are burdensome and inaccurate at detecting mild cognitive impairment and predicting Alzheimer’s disease risk. Altoida’s Digital Neuro Signature (DNS), a longitudinal cognitive test consisting of two active digital biomarker metrics, alleviates these limitations. By comparison to conventional neuropsychological assessments, DNS results in faster evaluations (10 min vs 45–120 min), and generates higher test-retest in intraindividual assessment, as well as higher accuracy at detecting abnormal cognition. This study comparatively evaluates the performance of Altoida’s DNS and conventional neuropsychological assessments in intraindividual assessments of cognition and function by means of two semi-naturalistic observational experiments with 525 participants in laboratory and clinical settings. The results show that DNS is consistently more sensitive than conventional neuropsychological assessments at capturing longitudinal individual-level change, both with respect to intraindividual variability and dispersion (intraindividual variability across multiple tests), across three participant groups: healthy controls, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer’s disease. Dispersion differences between DNS and conventional neuropsychological assessments were more pronounced with more advanced disease stages, and DNS-intraindividual variability was able to predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer’s disease. These findings are instrumental for patient monitoring and management, remote clinical trial assessment, and timely interventions, and will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of Alzheimer’s disease.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3204163491","numberInSourceReferences":63,"doi":"10.3390/BRAINSCI11101305","title":"The Potential Impact of Digital Biomarkers in Multiple Sclerosis in The Netherlands: An Early Health Technology Assessment of MS Sherpa","authors":[{"id":"A3202154335","orcid":null,"LN":"Cloosterman","FN":"Sonja","affil":"Orikami Digital Health Products, Ridderstraat 29, 6511 TM Nijmegen, The Netherlands."},{"id":"A4221920670","orcid":null,"LN":"Wijnands","FN":"Inez M.","affil":"Orikami Digital Health Products, Ridderstraat 29, 6511 TM Nijmegen, The Netherlands"},{"id":"A4346050113","orcid":null,"LN":"Huygens","FN":"Simone A.","affil":"Institute for Medical Technology Assessment (iMTA), Erasmus University of Rotterdam, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, 3062 PA Rotterdam, The Netherlands"},{"id":"A3002410530","orcid":"0000-0002-2691-7162","LN":"Wester","FN":"Valérie","affil":"Erasmus University Rotterdam (NL), Institute for Medical Technology Assessment (iMTA), Erasmus University of Rotterdam, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, 3062 PA Rotterdam, The Netherlands"},{"id":"A4356257181","orcid":null,"LN":"Lam","FN":"K.Y.","affil":"Amsterdam University Medical Centers (NL)"},{"id":"A4359225619","orcid":null,"LN":"Strijbis","FN":"Eva M.M.","affil":"Amsterdam University Medical Centers (NL)"},{"id":"A3090272294","orcid":"0000-0001-9084-5645","LN":"Teuling","FN":"Bram den","affil":"Orikami Digital Health Products, Ridderstraat 29, 6511 TM Nijmegen, The Netherlands"},{"id":"A4342382451","orcid":null,"LN":"Versteegh","FN":"Matthijs","affil":"Institute for Medical Technology Assessment (iMTA), Erasmus University of Rotterdam, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, 3062 PA Rotterdam, The Netherlands"}],"year":2021,"journal":"Brain Sciences (MDPI)","references":["W1850364293","W2013610409","W2060156088","W2084724611","W2095310389","W2112165124","W2157092569","W2318611315","W2396267917","W2588292672","W2753402496","W2802618918","W2890408626","W2908373864","W2913074512","W2955643247","W2995629548","W3089623732","W3129040874","W3165015517","W3193884874","W4241890711","W4249253433"],"citationsCount":4,"abstract":"(1) Background: Monitoring of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) with eHealth interventions or digital biomarkers provides added value to the current care path. Evidence in the literature is currently scarce. MS sherpa is an eHealth intervention with digital biomarkers, aimed at monitoring symptom progression and disease activity. To show the added value of digital biomarker-based eHealth interventions to the MS care path, an early Health Technology Assessment (eHTA) was performed, with MS sherpa as an example, to assess the potential impact on treatment switches. (2) Methods: The eHTA was performed according to the Dutch guidelines for health economic evaluations. A decision analytic MS model was used to estimate the costs and benefits of MS standard care with and without use of MS sherpa, expressed in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) from both societal and health care perspectives. The efficacy of MS sherpa on early detection of active disease and the initiation of a treatment switch were modeled for a range of assumed efficacy (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%). (3) Results: From a societal perspective, for the efficacy of 15% or 20%, MS sherpa became dominant, which means cost-saving compared to the standard of care. MS sherpa is cost-effective in the 5% and 10% scenarios (ICERs EUR 14,535 and EUR 4069, respectively). From the health care perspective, all scenarios were cost-effective. Sensitivity analysis showed that increasing the efficacy of MS sherpa in detecting active disease early leading to treatment switches be the most impactful factor in the MS model. (4) Conclusions: The results indicate the potential of eHealth interventions to be cost-effective or even cost-saving in the MS care path. As such, digital biomarker-based eHealth interventions, like MS sherpa, are promising cost-effective solutions in optimizing MS disease management for people with MS, by detecting active disease early and helping neurologists in decisions on treatment switch.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3196396697","numberInSourceReferences":68,"doi":"10.1016/J.EJCA.2021.06.049","title":"Skin cancer classification via convolutional neural networks: systematic review of studies involving human experts","authors":[{"id":"A3118282152","orcid":"0000-0002-7961-1781","LN":"Haggenmüller","FN":"Sarah","affil":"National Center for Tumor Diseases (DE), German Cancer Research Center (DE)"},{"id":"A4335506634","orcid":null,"LN":"Maron","FN":"Roman C.","affil":"National Center for Tumor Diseases (DE), German Cancer Research Center (DE)"},{"id":"A2889173625","orcid":"0000-0002-4974-2457","LN":"Hekler","FN":"Achim","affil":"National Center for Tumor Diseases (DE), German Cancer Research Center (DE)"},{"id":"A4359174079","orcid":null,"LN":"Utikal","FN":"Jochen","affil":"Heidelberg University (DE), German Cancer Research Center (DE)"},{"id":"A4350136760","orcid":null,"LN":"Barata","FN":"Catarina","affil":"Institute for Systems and Computer Engineering of Porto (PT)"},{"id":"A2095608265","orcid":"0000-0001-8086-8544","LN":"Barnhill","FN":"Raymond L.","affil":"Institute Curie (FR)"},{"id":"A1901735541","orcid":"0000-0002-8179-1793","LN":"Beltraminelli","FN":"Helmut","affil":"University Hospital of Bern (CH), University of Bern (CH)"},{"id":"A4358447211","orcid":null,"LN":"Berking","FN":"Carola","affil":"Universitätsklinikum Erlangen (DE)"},{"id":"A4358217091","orcid":null,"LN":"Betz-Stablein","FN":"Brigid","affil":"University of Queensland (AU)"},{"id":"A4340460601","orcid":null,"LN":"Blum","FN":"Andreas","affil":"Klinikum Konstanz (DE)"},{"id":"A4354425036","orcid":null,"LN":"Braun","FN":"Svende","affil":"Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf (DE), University Hospital Münster (DE)"},{"id":"A4358460855","orcid":null,"LN":"Carr","FN":"Richard D.","affil":"Warwick Hospital (GB)"},{"id":"A2788214097","orcid":"0000-0001-5237-4256","LN":"Combalia","FN":"Marc","affil":"University of Barcelona (ES)"},{"id":"A4358801458","orcid":null,"LN":"Fernández-Figueras","FN":"María Teresa","affil":"International University of Catalonia (ES)"},{"id":"A2513684563","orcid":"0000-0003-0727-4015","LN":"Ferrara","FN":"Gerardo","affil":"University of Macerata (IT)"},{"id":"A4353900468","orcid":null,"LN":"Fraitag","FN":"Sylvie","affil":"Hôpital Necker-Enfants Malades (FR)"},{"id":"A4355570573","orcid":null,"LN":"French","FN":"Lars E.","affil":"LMU Klinikum (DE), University of Miami (US)"},{"id":"A2803125286","orcid":"0000-0002-2164-4644","LN":"Gellrich","FN":"Frank Friedrich","affil":"National Center for Tumor Diseases (DE), University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus (DE), TU Dresden (DE)"},{"id":"A4359734695","orcid":null,"LN":"Ghoreschi","FN":"Kamran","affil":"Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin (DE)"},{"id":"A4357542395","orcid":null,"LN":"Goebeler","FN":"Matthias","affil":"University Hospital Würzburg (DE)"},{"id":"A4356839277","orcid":null,"LN":"Scolyer","FN":"Richard A.","affil":"Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (AU), Melanoma Institute Australia (AU), University of Sydney (AU)"},{"id":"A4358148283","orcid":null,"LN":"Haenssle","FN":"Holger A.","affil":"University Hospital Heidelberg (DE)"},{"id":"A4358143605","orcid":null,"LN":"Haferkamp","FN":"Sebastian","affil":"University Hospital Regensburg (DE)"},{"id":"A4357350210","orcid":null,"LN":"Heinzerling","FN":"Lucie","affil":"LMU Klinikum (DE)"},{"id":"A4355895651","orcid":null,"LN":"Heppt","FN":"Markus V.","affil":"Universitätsklinikum Erlangen (DE)"},{"id":"A4349732831","orcid":null,"LN":"Hilke","FN":"Franz J.","affil":"Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin (DE)"},{"id":"A3151922823","orcid":"0000-0001-5703-324X","LN":"Hobelsberger","FN":"Sarah","affil":"National Center for Tumor Diseases (DE), University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus (DE), TU Dresden (DE)"},{"id":"A4348034969","orcid":null,"LN":"Krahl","FN":"Dieter","affil":"Dres.

The search terms skin cancer classification, deep learning, convolutional neural network (CNN), melanoma (detection), digital biomarkers, histopathology and whole slide imaging were combined. Based on the search results, only studies that considered direct comparison of AI results with clinicians and had a diagnostic classification as their main objective were included.ResultsA total of 19 reader studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of these, 11 CNN-based approaches addressed the classification of dermoscopic images; 6 concentrated on the classification of clinical images, whereas 2 dermatopathological studies utilised digitised histopathological whole slide images.ConclusionsAll 19 included studies demonstrated superior or at least equivalent performance of CNN-based classifiers compared with clinicians. However, almost all studies were conducted in highly artificial settings based exclusively on single images of the suspicious lesions. Moreover, test sets mainly consisted of holdout images and did not represent the full range of patient populations and melanoma subtypes encountered in clinical practice.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3193354979","numberInSourceReferences":72,"doi":"10.3389/FPSYT.2021.701729","title":"A Phase II Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of the Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of Arbaclofen Administered for the Treatment of Social Function in Children and Adolescents With Autism Spectrum Disorders: Study Protocol for AIMS-2-TRIALS-CT1","authors":[{"id":"A2146148065","orcid":"0000-0001-7977-3601","LN":"Parellada","FN":"Mara","affil":"Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón (ES)"},{"id":"A4350924198","orcid":null,"LN":"Cáceres","FN":"Antonia San José","affil":"Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón (ES)"},{"id":"A4357702126","orcid":null,"LN":"Palmer","FN":"Melanie","affil":"King's College London (GB)"},{"id":"A4357204067","orcid":null,"LN":"Delorme","FN":"Richard","affil":"Hôpital Robert-Debré (FR), Institut Pasteur (FR)"},{"id":"A4356269454","orcid":null,"LN":"Jones","FN":"Emily","affil":"Birkbeck, University of London (GB)"},{"id":"A4357124586","orcid":null,"LN":"Parr","FN":"Jeremy R.","affil":"Cumbria Northumberland Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust (GB), National Health Service (GB), Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (GB), Great North Children's Hospital (GB), Newcastle University (GB)"},{"id":"A4357686203","orcid":null,"LN":"Anagnostou","FN":"Evdokia","affil":"University of Toronto (CA), Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital (CA)"},{"id":"A4359438378","orcid":null,"LN":"Murphy","FN":"Declan G.","affil":"King's College London (GB)"},{"id":"A4356865623","orcid":null,"LN":"Loth","FN":"Eva","affil":"King's College London (GB)"},{"id":"A4355907258","orcid":null,"LN":"Wang","FN":"Paul J.","affil":"Clinical Research Associates (US)"},{"id":"A4354347463","orcid":null,"LN":"Charman","FN":"Tony","affil":"King's College London (GB), South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (GB), National Health Service (GB)"},{"id":"A2147371737","orcid":"0000-0002-2502-6704","LN":"Strydom","FN":"Andre","affil":"King's College London (GB)"},{"id":"A4359106202","orcid":null,"LN":"Arango","FN":"Celso","affil":"Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón (ES)"}],"year":2021,"journal":"Frontiers in Psychiatry (Frontiers Media)","references":["W1539779735","W1541267199","W1577082455","W1994118694","W2018479094","W2025800428","W2035027696","W2043066229","W2073577145","W2078544102","W2085899173","W2098251401","W2110143479","W2129015921","W2129032286","W2132298395","W2148083007","W2157348568","W2316811866","W2323149989","W2330594182","W2396439512","W2474454227","W2536129703","W2545275594","W2588484621","W2617984397","W2942769136","W2945129130","W2970058996","W2981832088","W3012797216","W3027179734","W3030222299","W3080708866","W4234063125"],"citationsCount":5,"abstract":"Background: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD or autism) is characterized by difficulties in social communication and interaction, which negatively impact on individuals and their families' quality of life. Currently no pharmacological interventions have been shown to be effective for improving social communication in autism. Previous trials have indicated the potential of arbaclofen for improving social function among autistic children and adolescents with fluent speech. The AIMS2TRIALS-Clinical Trial 1 (AIMS-CT1) will examine whether arbaclofen is superior to placebo in improving social function and other secondary outcomes over 16 weeks, along with safety and tolerability profiles. Methods: AIMS-CT1 is an international, multi-site, double-blind, parallel group Phase II randomized clinical trial. It will include 130 males and females aged 5:0–17:11 years, with a diagnosis of ASD and fluent speech. Eligible participants will be randomized on a ratio of 1:1 for a 16-week treatment period. Medication will be titrated over 5 weeks. The primary outcome is the effect on social function from weeks 0 to 16 measured on the Socialization domain of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, 3rd edition TM . Secondary outcome measures include the CGI–S (Clinical Global Impression–Severity), CGI–I (Clinical Global Impression–Improvement), other areas of adaptive function, social communication and other autism symptoms, co-occurring behavior problems and health-related quality of life. Genetic and electrophysiological markers will be examined as potential stratifiers for treatment response. Exploratory novel digital technologies will also be used to measure change, examining simultaneously the validity of digital biomarkers in natural environments. The safety and tolerability of the drug will also be examined. Our protocol is very closely aligned with a parallel Canadian trial of 90 participants (ARBA Study, US NCT number: NCT03887676) to allow for secondary combined analyses. Outcomes will be compared using both an Intent-to-reat and Per Protocol approach.

In this narrative review, we cover the putative mechanisms of gait dysfunction in PD, the assessment of gait abnormalities, and the management of symptoms caused by the inherent difficulty in walking. Our understanding of the causes of gait problems in PD has progressed in recent times, moving from neurocognitive theory to correlates of affected neuronal pathways. In particular, this can be shown to correspond with abnormalities in responses to dual-task paradigms and dysfunction in cholinergic signaling. Great progress has been made in the sophistication and precision of gait assessment; however, it has firmly remained in the research domain. There is significant momentum behind wearable technologies that can be used by patients in their own environment, acting as digital biomarkers that can not only reflect progression but also independently discriminate PD from non-PD individuals. The treatment of gait dysfunction has historically relied on physical therapies and training combined with a view to mitigating the impact of such consequences as falls. Pharmacological therapies that are the mainstay of treatment in PD have tended to address symptoms like bradykinesia; however, optimization of dopaminergic therapies likely has a positive effect on quality of gait. Other targets have been assessed with the goal of improving gait, of which medications that improve cholinergic signaling appear most promising. Neuromodulation techniques are increasingly used in the form of deep-brain stimulation; however, standard targets, such as the globus pallidus interna, have a modest effect on gait. Considerable benefit has been seen through targeting the pedunculopontine nucleus, and a dual-target approach may be warranted. Stimulation of the spinal cord and brain through direct or magnetic approaches has been assessed, but requires further evidence.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3101320539","numberInSourceReferences":29,"doi":"10.1088/1361-6579/ABB8BF","title":"Machine learning for nocturnal mass diagnosis of atrial fibrillation in a population at risk of sleep-disordered breathing","authors":[{"id":"A3015547132","orcid":null,"LN":"Chocron","FN":"Armand","affil":"Technion – Israel Institute of Technology (IL)"},{"id":"A3105762188","orcid":null,"LN":"Efraim","FN":"Roi","affil":"Rambam Health Care Campus (IL)"},{"id":"A2965525218","orcid":null,"LN":"Mandel","FN":"Franck","affil":"Hôpital Rangueil (FR)"},{"id":"A4336978455","orcid":null,"LN":"Rueschman","FN":"Michael","affil":"Brigham and Women's Hospital (US), Circadian (United States) (US)"},{"id":"A2125895324","orcid":"0000-0003-2766-3309","LN":"Palmius","FN":"Niclas","affil":"University of Oxford (GB)"},{"id":"A4359794046","orcid":null,"LN":"Penzel","FN":"Thomas","affil":"Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin (DE), Saratov State University (RU)"},{"id":"A4354304491","orcid":null,"LN":"Elbaz","FN":"Meyer","affil":"Hôpital Rangueil (FR)"},{"id":"A4337814577","orcid":null,"LN":"Behar","FN":"Joachim","affil":"Technion – Israel Institute of Technology (IL)"}],"year":2020,"journal":"Physiological Measurement (IOP Publishing)","references":["W194485135","W1968981871","W1995675315","W1998670507","W2020001173","W2038436648","W2076501430","W2109127420","W2114775432","W2122930900","W2132505348","W2140005438","W2155103273","W2162273778","W2162800060","W2251482333","W2344257056","W2547585100","W2598361327","W2767829802","W2805075551","W2884795774","W2895333514","W2899314245","W2914297172","W2950062353","W2959442417","W2987985090","W2990444645","W3000145365"],"citationsCount":5,"abstract":"In this research, we introduce a new methodology for atrial fibrillation (AF) diagnosis during sleep in a large population sample at risk of sleep-disordered breathing.The approach leverages digital biomarkers and recent advances in machine learning (ML) for mass AF diagnosis from overnight-hours of single-channel electrocardiogram (ECG) recording. Four databases, totaling n = 3088 patients and p = 26 913 h of continuous single-channel electrocardiogram raw data were used. Three of the databases (n = 125, p = 2513) were used for training a ML model in recognizing AF events from beat-to-beat time series. Visit 1 of the sleep heart health study database (SHHS1, n = 2963, p = 24 400) was used as the test set to evaluate the feasibility of identifying prominent AF from polysomnographic recordings. By combining AF diagnosis history and a cardiologist's visual inspection of individuals suspected of having AF (n = 118), a total of 70 patients were diagnosed with prominent AF in SHHS1.Model prediction on SHHS1 showed an overall [Formula: see text]and [Formula: see text] in classifying individuals with or without prominent AF. [Formula: see text] was non-inferior (p = 0.03) for individuals with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥15 versus AHI < [Formula: see text]. Over 22% of correctly identified prominent AF rhythm cases were not previously documented as AF in SHHS1.Individuals with prominent AF can be automatically diagnosed from an overnight single-channel ECG recording, with an accuracy unaffected by the presence of moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea. This approach enables identifying a large proportion of AF individuals that were otherwise missed by regular care.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3112404339","numberInSourceReferences":36,"doi":"10.1002/TRC2.12094","title":"Choosing the right time granularity for analysis of digital biomarker trajectories","authors":[{"id":"A4334477792","orcid":null,"LN":"Wakim","FN":"Nicole I","affil":"University of Michigan–Ann Arbor (US)"},{"id":"A4354078045","orcid":null,"LN":"Braun","FN":"Thomas","affil":"University of Michigan–Ann Arbor (US)"},{"id":"A4359050033","orcid":null,"LN":"Kaye","FN":"Jeffrey","affil":"Oregon Health & Science University (US)"},{"id":"A4358035876","orcid":null,"LN":"Dodge","FN":"Hiroko H.","affil":"Oregon Health & Science University (US)"},{"id":"A3115236250","orcid":null,"LN":"Orcatech","FN":"for"}],"year":2020,"journal":"Alzheimer's & Dementia: Translational Research & Clinical Interventions (Elsevier BV)","references":["W1599571371","W1997718099","W2001215426","W2010038812","W2011573339","W2016787780","W2033345578","W2045299870","W2067165060","W2120888944","W2145819129","W2155579822","W2161574907","W2164133449","W2266461367","W2287781221","W2293838570","W2587196985","W2592980563","W2731963041","W2766920067","W2773678481","W2898791016","W2907326120","W3009285434","W3021971632"],"citationsCount":1,"abstract":"The use of digital biomarker data in dementia research provides the opportunity for frequent cognitive and functional assessments that was not previously available using conventional approaches. Assessing high-frequency digital biomarker data can potentially increase the opportunities for early detection of cognitive and functional decline because of improved precision of person-specific trajectories. However, we often face a decision to condense time-stamped data into a coarser time granularity, defined as the frequency at which measurements are observed or summarized, for statistical analyses. It is important to find a balance between ease of analysis by condensing data and the integrity of the data, which is reflected in a chosen time granularity.In this paper, we discuss factors that need to be considered when faced with a time granularity decision. These factors include follow-up time, variables of interest, pattern detection, and signal-to-noise ratio.We applied our procedure to real-world data which include longitudinal in-home monitored walking speed. The example shed lights on typical problems that data present and how we could use the above factors in exploratory analysis to choose an appropriate time granularity.Further work is required to explore issues with missing data and computational efficiency.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3013513933","numberInSourceReferences":44,"doi":"10.1016/J.JSAT.2020.02.005","title":"The application of digital health to the assessment and treatment of substance use disorders: The past, current, and future role of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network","authors":[{"id":"A4343910170","orcid":null,"LN":"Marsch","FN":"Lisa A.","affil":"Dartmouth College (US)"},{"id":"A4359756015","orcid":null,"LN":"Campbell","FN":"Aimee N.C.","affil":"Dartmouth College (US), Columbia University (US)"},{"id":"A4345498207","orcid":null,"LN":"Campbell","FN":"Cynthia I.","affil":"Kaiser Permanente (US)"},{"id":"A2899301747","orcid":"0000-0002-1020-0861","LN":"Chen","FN":"Ching-Hua","affil":"IBM Research - Thomas J.

The National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), launched in 1999 by the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse, has supported a growing line of research that leverages digital technologies to glean new insights into SUDs and provide science-based therapeutic tools to a diverse array of persons with SUDs.This manuscript provides an overview of the breadth and impact of research conducted in the realm of digital health within the CTN. This work has included the CTN's efforts to systematically embed digital screeners for SUDs into general medical settings to impact care models across the nation. This work has also included a pivotal multi-site clinical trial conducted on the CTN platform, whose data led to the very first “prescription digital therapeutic” authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of SUDs. Further CTN research includes the study of telehealth to increase capacity for science-based SUD treatment in rural and under-resourced communities. In addition, the CTN has supported an assessment of the feasibility of detecting cocaine-taking behavior via smartwatch sensing. And, the CTN has supported the conduct of clinical trials entirely online (including the recruitment of national and hard-to-reach/under-served participant samples online, with remote intervention delivery and data collection). Further, the CTN is supporting innovative work focused on the use of digital health technologies and data analytics to identify digital biomarkers and understand the clinical trajectories of individuals receiving medications for opioid use disorder (OUD).This manuscript concludes by outlining the many potential future opportunities to leverage the unique national CTN research network to scale-up the science on digital health to examine optimal strategies to increase the reach of science-based SUD service delivery models both within and outside of healthcare.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3036612457","numberInSourceReferences":46,"doi":"10.3233/SHTI200346","title":"SPHN/PHRT: Forming a Swiss-Wide Infrastructure for Data-Driven Sepsis Research.","authors":[{"id":"A4353381155","orcid":null,"LN":"Egli","FN":"Adrian","affil":"University of Basel (CH), University Hospital of Basel (CH)"},{"id":"A4355402680","orcid":null,"LN":"Battegay","FN":"Manuel","affil":"University Hospital of Basel (CH)"},{"id":"A4348628726","orcid":null,"LN":"Büchler","FN":"Andrea","affil":"University Hospital of Basel (CH)"},{"id":"A4353500805","orcid":null,"LN":"Bühlmann","FN":"Peter","affil":"ETH Zurich (CH)"},{"id":"A4353859634","orcid":null,"LN":"Calandra","FN":"Thierry","affil":"University of Lausanne (CH)"},{"id":"A4351733083","orcid":null,"LN":"Eckert","FN":"Philippe","affil":"University of Lausanne (CH)"},{"id":"A4359710529","orcid":null,"LN":"Furrer","FN":"Hansjakob","affil":"University Hospital of Bern (CH), University of Bern (CH)"},{"id":"A4358928313","orcid":null,"LN":"Greub","FN":"Gilbert","affil":"Institute for Medical Microbiology, University Hospital Lausanne, Lausanne."},{"id":"A4340356024","orcid":null,"LN":"Jakob","FN":"Stephan M.","affil":"University Hospital of Bern (CH), University of Bern (CH)"},{"id":"A2143318466","orcid":"0000-0002-0857-2252","LN":"Kaiser","FN":"Laurent","affil":"University Hospital of Geneva (CH)"},{"id":"A4339322325","orcid":null,"LN":"Leib","FN":"Stephen L.","affil":"University of Bern (CH)"},{"id":"A4355572826","orcid":null,"LN":"Marsch","FN":"Stephan","affil":"Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel."},{"id":"A4355173019","orcid":null,"LN":"Meinshausen","FN":"Nicolai","affil":"ETH Zurich (CH)"},{"id":"A2036305831","orcid":null,"LN":"Pagani","FN":"Jean-Luc","affil":"University of Lausanne (CH)"},{"id":"A4332991255","orcid":null,"LN":"Pugin","FN":"Jérôme","affil":"University Hospital of Geneva (CH)"},{"id":"A4359412319","orcid":null,"LN":"Rätsch","FN":"Gunnar","affil":"ETH Zurich (CH)"},{"id":"A4356580539","orcid":null,"LN":"Schrenzel","FN":"Jacques","affil":"University Hospital of Geneva (CH)"},{"id":"A4359581131","orcid":null,"LN":"Schuepbach","FN":"Reto A.","affil":"University Hospital of Zurich (CH)"},{"id":"A4356470036","orcid":null,"LN":"Siegemund","FN":"Martin","affil":"Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel."},{"id":"A1794252089","orcid":"0000-0003-1271-1021","LN":"Zamboni","FN":"Nicola","affil":"ETH Zurich (CH)"},{"id":"A4340569897","orcid":null,"LN":"Zbinden","FN":"Reinhard","affil":"University of Zurich (CH)"},{"id":"A4358555820","orcid":null,"LN":"Zinkernagel","FN":"Annelies S.","affil":"University Hospital of Zurich (CH)"},{"id":"A2086114595","orcid":"0000-0001-7221-2393","LN":"Borgwardt","FN":"Karsten M.","affil":"ETH Zurich (CH)"}],"year":2020,"journal":"PubMed (National Institutes of Health)","references":[],"citationsCount":2,"abstract":"Sepsis is a highly heterogenous syndrome with variable causes and outcomes.

With demonstrated potential in myriad applications, ranging from systemic inflammation reduction to traumatic stress attenuation, closed-loop tcVNS during periods of risk could improve treatment efficacy and reduce ineffective delivery. However, achieving this requires a deeper understanding of biomarker changes over time.The aim of the present study was to reveal the dynamics of relevant cardiovascular biomarkers, extracted from wearable sensing modalities, in response to tcVNS.Twenty-four human subjects were recruited for a randomized double-blind clinical trial, for whom electrocardiography and photoplethysmography were used to measure heart rate and photoplethysmogram amplitude responses to tcVNS, respectively. Modeling these responses in state-space, we (1) compared the biomarkers in terms of their predictability and active vs sham differentiation, (2) studied the latency between stimulation onset and measurable effects, and (3) visualized the true and model-simulated biomarker responses to tcVNS.The models accurately predicted future heart rate and photoplethysmogram amplitude values with root mean square errors of approximately one-fifth the standard deviations of the data. Moreover, (1) the photoplethysmogram amplitude showed superior predictability (P=.03) and active vs sham separation compared to heart rate; (2) a consistent delay of greater than 5 seconds was found between tcVNS onset and cardiovascular effects; and (3) dynamic characteristics differentiated responses to tcVNS from the sham stimulation.This work furthers the state of the art by modeling pertinent biomarker responses to tcVNS. Through subsequent analysis, we discovered three key findings with implications related to (1) wearable sensing devices for bioelectronic medicine, (2) the dominant mechanism of action for tcVNS-induced effects on cardiovascular physiology, and (3) the existence of dynamic biomarker signatures that can be leveraged when titrating therapy in closed loop.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02992899; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02992899.RR2-10.1016/j.brs.2019.08.002.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3005993122","numberInSourceReferences":75,"doi":"10.1177/1932296820904947","title":"Noninvasive Continuous Monitoring of Vital Signs With Wearables: Fit for Medical Use?","authors":[{"id":"A3196198149","orcid":"0000-0003-0780-0003","LN":"Jacobsen","FN":"Malte","affil":"Witten/Herdecke University (DE)"},{"id":"A4356791377","orcid":null,"LN":"Dembek","FN":"Till A.","affil":"University Hospital Cologne (DE)"},{"id":"A4333153964","orcid":null,"LN":"Kobbe","FN":"Guido","affil":"Düsseldorf University Hospital (DE)"},{"id":"A2481016522","orcid":null,"LN":"Gaidzik","FN":"Peter W.","affil":"Witten/Herdecke University (DE)"},{"id":"A4354448739","orcid":null,"LN":"Heinemann","FN":"Lutz","affil":"Science-Consulting in Diabetes, Neuss, Germany."}],"year":2020,"journal":"Journal of diabetes science and technology (SAGE Publishing)","references":["W1542150682","W1618395985","W1994395028","W2001286221","W2009478230","W2029539374","W2034180472","W2042445733","W2063735882","W2083872334","W2101132022","W2110143693","W2127276935","W2127512944","W2153203930","W2159777593","W2178720062","W2191728430","W2200049143","W2220182234","W2266982813","W2299518025","W2332537596","W2346057711","W2402006737","W2479978653","W2508440416","W2508534950","W2514523036","W2519620145","W2522531501","W2530450109","W2537147646","W2543339411","W2548170855","W2559802784","W2560205657","W2564914915","W2567648164","W2567656490","W2576160782","W2576530535","W2581195603","W2589153749","W2594925199","W2597782088","W2600667840","W2604425430","W2607900979","W2609616328","W2609932996","W2614425828","W2618476515","W2620854895","W2622921962","W2625854397","W2735136142","W2736055814","W2739055254","W2745165369","W2745170824","W2749369527","W2752747624","W2752908080","W2753104431","W2756071038","W2764050853","W2764203772","W2767543826","W2767804936","W2775285716","W2775554754","W2775960122","W2782926979","W2783633730","W2790668025","W2791256585","W2791752902","W2795264086","W2800632280","W2801971446","W2807918714","W2869528658","W2888540279","W2889166151","W2898098650","W2898617434","W2915056836","W2971998890","W2987985090"],"citationsCount":15,"abstract":"Wearables (= wearable computer) enable continuous and noninvasive monitoring of a range of vital signs.

The growing number of individuals with chronic conditions makes this support model unsustainably burdensome on health care systems globally. Mobile health technologies are increasingly being used throughout health care to facilitate communication, track disease, and provide educational support to patients. Such technologies show promise, yet they are not being used to their full extent within US health care systems.The purpose of this study was to examine the use of staff and costs of a remote monitoring care model in persons with and without a chronic condition.At Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health, 2894 employees volunteered to monitor their health, transmit data for analysis, and communicate digitally with a care team. Volunteers received Bluetooth-connected consumer-grade devices that were paired to a mobile phone app that facilitated digital communication with nursing and health behavior change staff. Health data were collected and automatically analyzed, and behavioral support communications were generated based on those analyses. Care support staff were automatically alerted according to purpose-developed algorithms. In a subgroup of participants and matched controls, we used difference-in-difference techniques to examine changes in per capita expenditures.Participants averaged 41 years of age; 72.70% (2104/2894) were female and 12.99% (376/2894) had at least one chronic condition. On average each month, participants submitted 23 vital sign measurements, engaged in 1.96 conversations, and received 0.25 automated messages. Persons with chronic conditions accounted for 39.74% (8587/21,607) of all staff conversations, with higher per capita conversation rates for all shifts compared to those without chronic conditions (P<.001). Additionally, persons with chronic conditions engaged nursing staff more than those without chronic conditions (1.40 and 0.19 per capita conversations, respectively, P<.001). When compared to the same period in the prior year, per capita health care expenditures for persons with chronic conditions dropped by 15% (P=.06) more than did those for matched controls.The technology-based chronic condition management care model was frequently used and demonstrated potential for cost savings among participants with chronic conditions. While further studies are necessary, this model appears to be a promising solution to efficiently provide patients with personalized care, when and where they need it.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2948916967","numberInSourceReferences":14,"doi":"10.20900/AGMR20190003","title":"Aging Well: Using Precision to Drive Down Costs and Increase Health Quality","authors":[{"id":"A4356560111","orcid":null,"LN":"Au","FN":"Rhoda","affil":"Boston University (US)"},{"id":"A4351775463","orcid":null,"LN":"Ritchie","FN":"Marina","affil":"Boston University (US)"},{"id":"A2896865997","orcid":null,"LN":"Hardy","FN":"Spencer","affil":"Boston University (US)"},{"id":"A4356708086","orcid":null,"LN":"Ang","FN":"Ting Fang Alvin","affil":"Framingham Heart Study (US), National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (US)"},{"id":"A2141518049","orcid":"0000-0003-3043-3942","LN":"Lin","FN":"Honghuang","affil":"Framingham Heart Study (US), National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (US)"}],"year":2019,"references":["W1581785133","W1993049201","W2010415415","W2029480581","W2042793251","W2052534047","W2058862064","W2080418085","W2083384763","W2120751691","W2121026234","W2125065061","W2129274331","W2134527364","W2166009908","W2171658186","W2176372762","W2177693422","W2209509913","W2288777108","W2296350496","W2343010276","W2463406035","W2564164847","W2591382767","W2753007908","W2768132193","W2781525129","W2786211709","W2790706219","W2801025552","W2811364956","W2885372472","W2895292592","W2895507097","W2910249624","W2913705661","W2963044149","W4210707681","W4237979515"],"citationsCount":7,"abstract":"Efforts to provide patients with individualized treatments have led to tremendous breakthroughs in healthcare.

The study interrogated aspects of this movement disorder through surveys and frequent sensor-based recordings from participants with and without Parkinson disease. Benefitting from large enrollment and repeated measurements on many individuals, these data may help establish baseline variability of real-world activity measurement collected via mobile phones, and ultimately may lead to quantification of the ebbs-and-flows of Parkinson symptoms.

Although this diversity is undoubtedly valuable, it can lead to confusion regarding terminology and best practices. There are many instances, as we detail in this paper, where a single term is used by different groups to mean different things, as well as cases where multiple terms are used to describe essentially the same concept. Our intent is to clarify core terminology and best practices for the evaluation of Biometric Monitoring Technologies (BioMeTs), without unnecessarily introducing new terms. We focus on the evaluation of BioMeTs as fit-for-purpose for use in clinical trials. However, our intent is for this framework to be instructional to all users of digital measurement tools, regardless of setting or intended use. We propose and describe a three-component framework intended to provide a foundational evaluation framework for BioMeTs. This framework includes (1) verification, (2) analytical validation, and (3) clinical validation. We aim for this common vocabulary to enable more effective communication and collaboration, generate a common and meaningful evidence base for BioMeTs, and improve the accessibility of the digital medicine field.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2987985090","numberInSourceReferences":14,"doi":"10.1056/NEJMOA1901183","title":"Large-Scale Assessment of a Smartwatch to Identify Atrial Fibrillation","authors":[{"id":"A4355858952","orcid":null,"LN":"Perez","FN":"Marco V"},{"id":"A4356612131","orcid":null,"LN":"Mahaffey","FN":"Kenneth W.","affil":"University of Colorado Denver (US)"},{"id":"A4356805492","orcid":null,"LN":"Hedlin","FN":"Haley","affil":"Cooper Medical School of Rowan University (US)"},{"id":"A4352163285","orcid":null,"LN":"Rumsfeld","FN":"John S.","affil":"Lankenau Heart Institute (US)"},{"id":"A4335663416","orcid":null,"LN":"Garcia","FN":"Ariadna","affil":"American Society for Reproductive Medicine (US)"},{"id":"A4335481071","orcid":null,"LN":"Ferris","FN":"Todd A.","affil":"Clinical Research Institute (US), Duke University (US)"},{"id":"A2164393189","orcid":"0000-0002-9335-1568","LN":"Balasubramanian","FN":"Vidhya"},{"id":"A4354048814","orcid":null,"LN":"Russo","FN":"Andrea M."},{"id":"A4346743165","orcid":null,"LN":"Rajmane","FN":"Amol"},{"id":"A2920075919","orcid":null,"LN":"Cheung","FN":"Lauren"},{"id":"A2142457436","orcid":null,"LN":"Hung","FN":"Grace Kin-Yee"},{"id":"A4359370009","orcid":null,"LN":"Lee","FN":"Justin"},{"id":"A4345627752","orcid":null,"LN":"Kowey","FN":"Peter R."},{"id":"A2898896265","orcid":null,"LN":"Talati","FN":"Nisha"},{"id":"A1983111620","orcid":null,"LN":"Nag","FN":"Divya"},{"id":"A3044384436","orcid":null,"LN":"Gummidipundi","FN":"Santosh"},{"id":"A2128039366","orcid":"0000-0001-8405-7386","LN":"Beatty","FN":"Alexis L."},{"id":"A4337156394","orcid":null,"LN":"Hills","FN":"Mellanie True"},{"id":"A2731357168","orcid":null,"LN":"Desai","FN":"Sumbul A"},{"id":"A4357391402","orcid":null,"LN":"Granger","FN":"Christopher B."},{"id":"A4357237330","orcid":null,"LN":"Desai","FN":"Manisha"},{"id":"A4354529493","orcid":null,"LN":"Turakhia","FN":"Mintu P."},{"id":"A3118377197","orcid":null,"LN":"Investigators","FN":"Apple Heart Study"}],"year":2019,"references":["W2065028337","W2114775432","W2154658516","W2170350621","W2767998629","W2790444357","W2793042064","W2796973873","W2802347767","W2869528658","W2897370809","W2899314245"],"citations":[],"citationsCount":889,"abstract":"Optical sensors on wearable devices can detect irregular pulses.

We investigated the use of these devices to monitor human physiological changes during various activities and their role in managing health and diagnosing and analyzing disease. By recording over 250,000 daily measurements for up to 43 individuals, we found personalized circadian differences in physiological parameters, replicating previous physiological findings. Interestingly, we found striking changes in particular environments, such as airline flights (decreased peripheral capillary oxygen saturation [SpO2] and increased radiation exposure). These events are associated with physiological macro-phenotypes such as fatigue, providing a strong association between reduced pressure/oxygen and fatigue on high-altitude flights. Importantly, we combined biosensor information with frequent medical measurements and made two important observations: First, wearable devices were useful in identification of early signs of Lyme disease and inflammatory responses; we used this information to develop a personalized, activity-based normalization framework to identify abnormal physiological signals from longitudinal data for facile disease detection. Second, wearables distinguish physiological differences between insulin-sensitive and -resistant individuals. Overall, these results indicate that portable biosensors provide useful information for monitoring personal activities and physiology and are likely to play an important role in managing health and enabling affordable health care access to groups traditionally limited by socioeconomic class or remote geography.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2347128633","numberInSourceReferences":10,"doi":"10.2196/MENTAL.5165","title":"New Tools for New Research in Psychiatry: A Scalable and Customizable Platform to Empower Data Driven Smartphone Research","authors":[{"id":"A4357340533","orcid":null,"LN":"Torous","FN":"John"},{"id":"A4357309130","orcid":null,"LN":"Kiang","FN":"Mathew V."},{"id":"A2946082103","orcid":"0000-0003-3083-122X","LN":"Lorme","FN":"Jeanette"},{"id":"A4359395626","orcid":null,"LN":"Onnela","FN":"Jukka-Pekka"}],"year":2016,"journal":"JMIR mental health (JMIR Publications)","references":["W131446000","W565833860","W1267646904","W1487091206","W1522850626","W1544540079","W1750132612","W1894490285","W1975670345","W1977465442","W1982300822","W1984885556","W1984921391","W1985221769","W1987888818","W1993925969","W2001640574","W2008289090","W2029454745","W2041314641","W2043705607","W2068181924","W2077154222","W2077641238","W2083734720","W2086536235","W2091230101","W2095146280","W2095550376","W2096358051","W2100133323","W2102719109","W2105527159","W2107921336","W2112392909","W2114715323","W2117046315","W2117239687","W2121621539","W2130042179","W2132485329","W2138174165","W2141113219","W2151487996","W2155002669","W2161897659","W2165397843","W2165494109","W2166739899","W2168966242","W2402464555","W3100507627","W3171418018","W4323966175"],"citations":[],"citationsCount":383,"abstract":"Background A longstanding barrier to progress in psychiatry, both in clinical settings and research trials, has been the persistent difficulty of accurately and reliably quantifying disease phenotypes. Mobile phone technology combined with data science has the potential to offer medicine a wealth of additional information on disease phenotypes, but the large majority of existing smartphone apps are not intended for use as biomedical research platforms and, as such, do not generate research-quality data. Objective Our aim is not the creation of yet another app per se but rather the establishment of a platform to collect research-quality smartphone raw sensor and usage pattern data. Our ultimate goal is to develop statistical, mathematical, and computational methodology to enable us and others to extract biomedical and clinical insights from smartphone data. Methods We report on the development and early testing of Beiwe, a research platform featuring a study portal, smartphone app, database, and data modeling and analysis tools designed and developed specifically for transparent, customizable, and reproducible biomedical research use, in particular for the study of psychiatric and neurological disorders. We also outline a proposed study using the platform for patients with schizophrenia. Results We demonstrate the passive data capabilities of the Beiwe platform and early results of its analytical capabilities. Conclusions Smartphone sensors and phone usage patterns, when coupled with appropriate statistical learning tools, are able to capture various social and behavioral manifestations of illnesses, in naturalistic settings, as lived and experienced by patients. The ubiquity of smartphones makes this type of moment-by-moment quantification of disease phenotypes highly scalable and, when integrated within a transparent research platform, presents tremendous opportunities for research, discovery, and patient health.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2559820773","numberInSourceReferences":11,"doi":"10.1515/CDBME-2016-0128","title":"Digital health and digital biomarkers – enabling value chains on health data","authors":[{"id":"A4346706395","orcid":null,"LN":"Meister","FN":"Sven","affil":"Fraunhofer Institute for Software and Systems Engineering (DE)"},{"id":"A4347272794","orcid":null,"LN":"Deiters","FN":"Wolfgang","affil":"Fraunhofer Institute for Software and Systems Engineering (DE)"},{"id":"A2234666331","orcid":"0000-0002-9619-3542","LN":"Becker","FN":"Stefan","affil":"Essen University Hospital (DE)"}],"year":2016,"journal":"Current Directions in Biomedical Engineering (De Gruyter)","references":["W350516475","W1619487752","W1685141321","W1980541833","W1988681682","W2028891040","W2037924767","W2083872334","W2110952200","W2119744858","W2184154938","W2202295043","W3098825397","W4235301968"],"citations":[],"citationsCount":27,"abstract":"Abstract Smart Devices, IoT and Co. are changing healthcare.

Mobile phones are ubiquitous and have an increasingly large complement of sensors that can potentially be useful in monitoring behavioral patterns that might be indicative of depressive symptoms.The objective of this study was to explore the detection of daily-life behavioral markers using mobile phone global positioning systems (GPS) and usage sensors, and their use in identifying depressive symptom severity.A total of 40 adult participants were recruited from the general community to carry a mobile phone with a sensor data acquisition app (Purple Robot) for 2 weeks. Of these participants, 28 had sufficient sensor data received to conduct analysis. At the beginning of the 2-week period, participants completed a self-reported depression survey (PHQ-9). Behavioral features were developed and extracted from GPS location and phone usage data.A number of features from GPS data were related to depressive symptom severity, including circadian movement (regularity in 24-hour rhythm; r=-.63, P=.005), normalized entropy (mobility between favorite locations; r=-.58, P=.012), and location variance (GPS mobility independent of location; r=-.58, P=.012). Phone usage features, usage duration, and usage frequency were also correlated (r=.54, P=.011, and r=.52, P=.015, respectively). Using the normalized entropy feature and a classifier that distinguished participants with depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score ≥5) from those without (PHQ-9 score <5), we achieved an accuracy of 86.5%. Furthermore, a regression model that used the same feature to estimate the participants' PHQ-9 scores obtained an average error of 23.5%.Features extracted from mobile phone sensor data, including GPS and phone usage, provided behavioral markers that were strongly related to depressive symptom severity. While these findings must be replicated in a larger study among participants with confirmed clinical symptoms, they suggest that phone sensors offer numerous clinical opportunities, including continuous monitoring of at-risk populations with little patient burden and interventions that can provide just-in-time outreach.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W1599571371","numberInSourceReferences":13,"doi":"10.3389/FNAGI.2015.00102","title":"Pervasive Computing Technologies to Continuously Assess Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Progression and Intervention Efficacy","authors":[{"id":"A4340067347","orcid":null,"LN":"Lyons","FN":"Bayard","affil":"Oregon Health & Science University (US)"},{"id":"A4358766340","orcid":null,"LN":"Austin","FN":"Daniel F.","affil":"Oregon Health & Science University (US)"},{"id":"A4350851337","orcid":null,"LN":"Seelye","FN":"Adriana","affil":"Oregon Health & Science University (US)"},{"id":"A4333016167","orcid":null,"LN":"Petersen","FN":"Johanna","affil":"Oregon Health & Science University (US)"},{"id":"A2494527424","orcid":null,"LN":"Yeargers","FN":"Jonathan","affil":"Oregon Health & Science University (US)"},{"id":"A4359141834","orcid":null,"LN":"Riley","FN":"Thomas V.","affil":"Oregon Health & Science University (US)"},{"id":"A2303329766","orcid":"0000-0003-2794-3271","LN":"Sharma","FN":"Nicole","affil":"Oregon Health & Science University (US)"},{"id":"A668326849","orcid":"0000-0003-2623-1969","LN":"Mattek","FN":"Nora","affil":"Oregon Health & Science University (US)"},{"id":"A4345364243","orcid":null,"LN":"Wild","FN":"Katherine","affil":"Oregon Health & Science University (US)"},{"id":"A4358849620","orcid":null,"LN":"Dodge","FN":"Hiroko H.","affil":"Oregon Health & Science University (US)"},{"id":"A4359050033","orcid":null,"LN":"Kaye","FN":"Jeffrey","affil":"Oregon Health & Science University (US), Portland VA Medical Center (US)"}],"year":2015,"journal":"Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience (Frontiers Media)","references":["W2321995","W263752755","W1490114009","W1535222849","W1666494805","W1937723447","W1967197730","W1968703316","W1972700290","W1976949208","W1980267938","W1981612428","W1982300822","W1984866003","W1985230345","W1987561750","W1988254138","W1995785495","W1997718099","W2003490123","W2006302401","W2006333070","W2007142082","W2009270660","W2009801519","W2028388139","W2033345578","W2034232242","W2040213688","W2041988633","W2044992227","W2045299870","W2045440422","W2047591302","W2055531721","W2056929468","W2059743726","W2060516588","W2064201832","W2069093490","W2071705529","W2078929245","W2083561884","W2084021378","W2088361570","W2090840528","W2092124750","W2092877006","W2096555547","W2098109163","W2098516684","W2098631199","W2099247170","W2100763314","W2106197305","W2106716710","W2107334728","W2108181825","W2121356995","W2121895804","W2123197549","W2125593110","W2134717514","W2139206156","W2139540989","W2139609044","W2140884566","W2143072217","W2143554828","W2143987412","W2144759912","W2149230781","W2151780102","W2152255707","W2152582606","W2155151233","W2155253852","W2155579822","W2156108549","W2161182511","W2161574907","W2318948795","W2320577751","W2320709267","W2335127946","W2432184956","W2471354286","W3098098882","W4243663932","W4255660305"],"citations":[],"citationsCount":66,"abstract":"Traditionally, assessment of functional and cognitive status of individuals with dementia occurs in brief clinic visits during which time clinicians extract a snapshot of recent changes in individuals' health. Conventionally, this is done using various clinical assessment tools applied at the point of care and relies on patients' and caregivers' ability to accurately recall daily activity and trends in personal health. These practices suffer from the infrequency and generally short durations of visits. Since 2004, researchers at the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology (ORCATECH) at the Oregon Health and Science University have been working on developing technologies to transform this model. ORCATECH researchers have developed a system of continuous in-home monitoring using pervasive computing technologies that make it possible to more accurately track activities and behaviors and measure relevant intra-individual changes. We have installed a system of strategically placed sensors in over 480 homes and have been collecting data for up to 8 years. Using this continuous in-home monitoring system, ORCATECH researchers have collected data on multiple behaviors such as gait and mobility, sleep and activity patterns, medication adherence, and computer use. Patterns of intra-individual variation detected in each of these areas are used to predict outcomes such as low mood, loneliness, and cognitive function. These methods have the potential to improve the quality of patient health data and in turn patient care especially related to cognitive decline. Furthermore, the continuous real-world nature of the data may improve the efficiency and ecological validity of clinical intervention studies.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W1847168837","numberInSourceReferences":15,"doi":"10.1016/0022-3956(75)90026-6","title":"“Mini-mental state”","authors":[{"id":"A4336616738","orcid":null,"LN":"Folstein","FN":"Marshal F.","affil":"NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital (US), University of Oregon (US)"},{"id":"A4358510457","orcid":null,"LN":"Folstein","FN":"Susan E.","affil":"NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital (US), University of Oregon (US)"},{"id":"A2152284147","orcid":null,"LN":"McHugh","FN":"Paul R.","affil":"NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital (US), University of Oregon (US)"}],"year":1975,"journal":"Journal of Psychiatric Research (Elsevier BV)","references":["W1987736762","W2063977404","W2127626512","W2135732400","W4248184440"],"citations":[],"citationsCount":74181,"isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2592797645","numberInSourceReferences":20,"doi":"10.1038/TP.2017.25","title":"New dimensions and new tools to realize the potential of RDoC: digital phenotyping via smartphones and connected devices","authors":[{"id":"A4357340533","orcid":null,"LN":"Torous","FN":"John","affil":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (US), Harvard University (US)"},{"id":"A4359395626","orcid":null,"LN":"Onnela","FN":"Jukka-Pekka","affil":"Harvard University (US)"},{"id":"A4354199291","orcid":null,"LN":"Keshavan","FN":"Matcheri S.","affil":"Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (US), Harvard University (US)"}],"year":2017,"journal":"Translational Psychiatry (Nature Portfolio)","references":["W1965468519","W1994170575","W2029454745","W2042806762","W2044893824","W2046711058","W2084367026","W2118154726","W2118540296","W2130042179","W2133304638","W2144721638","W2158282570","W2160939822","W2167938116","W2201343262","W2261303017","W2267837598","W2319421021","W2330897937","W2347128633","W2392412101","W2442768873","W4247665917"],"citations":[],"citationsCount":254,"abstract":"Mobile and connected devices like smartphones and wearable sensors can facilitate the collection of novel naturalistic and longitudinal data relevant to psychiatry at both the personal and population level.

However, more information has not translated into a greater understanding of disease complexity to satisfy diagnostic and therapeutic needs. Challenges include noncompatible technology platforms, the need for wide-scale and long-term deployment of sensor technology (among vulnerable elderly patients in particular), and the gap between the \"big data\" acquired with sensitive measurement technologies and their limited clinical application. Major opportunities could be realized if new technologies are developed as part of open-source and/or open-hardware platforms that enable multichannel data capture sensitive to the broad range of motor and nonmotor problems that characterize PD and are adaptable into self-adjusting, individualized treatment delivery systems. The International Parkinson and Movement Disorders Society Task Force on Technology is entrusted to convene engineers, clinicians, researchers, and patients to promote the development of integrated measurement and closed-loop therapeutic systems with high patient adherence that also serve to (1) encourage the adoption of clinico-pathophysiologic phenotyping and early detection of critical disease milestones, (2) enhance the tailoring of symptomatic therapy, (3) improve subgroup targeting of patients for future testing of disease-modifying treatments, and (4) identify objective biomarkers to improve the longitudinal tracking of impairments in clinical care and research.

Participants then took the smart phones home to perform the five tasks four times a day for a month. Once a week participants had a remote (telemedicine) visit with a Parkinson disease specialist in which a modified (excluding assessments of rigidity and balance) UPDRS performed. Using statistical analyses of the five tasks recorded using the smartphone from 10 individuals with PD and 10 controls, we sought to: (1) discriminate whether the participant had PD and (2) predict the modified motor portion of the UPDRS.Twenty participants performed an average of 2.7 tests per day (68.9% adherence) for the study duration (average of 34.4 days) in a home and community setting. The analyses of the five tasks differed between those with Parkinson disease and those without. In discriminating participants with PD from controls, the mean sensitivity was 96.2% (SD 2%) and mean specificity was 96.9% (SD 1.9%). The mean error in predicting the modified motor component of the UPDRS (range 11-34) was 1.26 UPDRS points (SD 0.16).Measuring PD symptoms via a smartphone is feasible and has potential value as a diagnostic support tool.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W91108901","numberInSourceReferences":17,"doi":"10.1067/MCP.2001.113989","title":"Biomarkers and surrogate endpoints: Preferred definitions and conceptual framework","authors":[],"year":2001,"references":["W1947582981","W1992894877","W1999094873","W1999682728","W2000580951","W2008596887","W2029131043","W2039821298","W2053727571","W2055665803","W2068869745","W2068893684","W2080675410","W2082515490","W2114605626","W2142257518","W2144584029","W2145053304","W2147246240","W2155949904","W2306744213","W2435538673","W2520163263"],"citations":[],"citationsCount":5168,"abstract":"Clinical Pharmacology & TherapeuticsVolume 69, Issue 3 p. 89-95 Commentary Biomarkers and surrogate endpoints: Preferred definitions and conceptual framework Biomarkers Definitions Working Group, Biomarkers Definitions Working GroupSearch for more papers by this author Biomarkers Definitions Working Group, Biomarkers Definitions Working GroupSearch for more papers by this author First published: 18 March 2001 https://doi.org/10.1067/mcp.2001.113989Citations: 522 Portions of this article were previously published as a conference proceedings report: Downing GJ, editor.

Sensor derived digital measures of health, such as digital biomarkers or digital clinical outcome assessments, may be used to monitor health status or the risk of adverse events like falls. Current research around such digital measures has largely focused on exploring the use of few individual measures obtained through mobile devices. However, especially for long-term applications in older adults, this choice of technology may not be ideal and could further add to the digital divide. Moreover, large-scale systems biology approaches, like genomics, have already proven beneficial in precision medicine, making it plausible that the same could also hold for remote-health monitoring. In this context, we introduce and describe a zero-interaction digital exhaust: a set of 1268 digital measures that cover large parts of a person's activity, behavior and physiology. Making this approach more inclusive of older adults, we base this set entirely on contactless, zero-interaction sensing technologies. Applying the resulting digital exhaust to real-world data, we then demonstrate the possibility to create multiple ageing relevant digital clinical outcome assessments. Paired with modern machine learning, we find these assessments to be surprisingly powerful and often on-par with mobile approaches. Lastly, we highlight the possibility to discover novel digital biomarkers based on this large-scale approach.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4361279451","numberInSourceReferences":2,"doi":"10.1038/S41531-023-00494-0","title":"A scoping review of neurodegenerative manifestations in explainable digital

nowadays no longer view neurodegenerative diseases, like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, as single entities, but rather as a spectrum of multifaceted symptoms with heterogeneous progression courses and treatment responses. The definition of the naturalistic behavioral repertoire of early neurodegenerative manifestations is still elusive, impeding early diagnosis and intervention. Central to this view is the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in reinforcing the depth of phenotypic information, thereby supporting the paradigm shift to precision medicine and personalized healthcare. This suggestion advocates the definition of disease subtypes in a new biomarker-supported nosology framework, yet without empirical consensus on standardization, reliability and interpretability. Although the well-defined neurodegenerative processes, linked to a triad of motor and non-motor preclinical symptoms, are detected by clinical intuition, we undertake an unbiased data-driven approach to identify different patterns of neuropathology distribution based on the naturalistic behavior data inherent to populations in-the-wild. We appraise the role of remote technologies in the definition of digital phenotyping specific to brain-, body- and social-level neurodegenerative subtle symptoms, emphasizing inter- and intra-patient variability powered by deep learning. As such, the present review endeavors to exploit digital technologies and AI to create disease-specific phenotypic explanations, facilitating the understanding of neurodegenerative diseases as \"bio-psycho-social\" conditions. Not only does this translational effort within explainable digital phenotyping foster the understanding of disease-induced traits, but it also enhances diagnostic and, eventually, treatment personalization.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4320016209","numberInSourceReferences":3,"doi":"10.1177/20539517221145680","title":"Short-circuiting biology: Digital phenotypes, digital biomarkers, and shifting gazes in psychiatry","authors":[{"id":"A1571876641","orcid":"0000-0001-8773-9796","LN":"Mulinari","FN":"Shai","affil":"Lund University (SE)"}],"year":2023,"journal":"Big Data & Society (SAGE Publishing)","references":["W91108901","W1522850626","W1535790300","W1553660386","W1968380849","W1975466886","W1986365151","W1996455722","W2002764085","W2007993885","W2014578307","W2018881137","W2039643193","W2049941951","W2054625329","W2075757880","W2087256811","W2089325836","W2104104529","W2112031167","W2141637710","W2157150618","W2172155812","W2295979545","W2347128633","W2520441859","W2567289819","W2592797645","W2756529428","W2759174152","W2789662105","W2800504696","W2808489527","W2889358587","W2895486342","W2903606943","W2941322871","W2968807426","W2984647055","W2986271391","W3005594308","W3016517870","W3028078961","W3037427354","W3041131903","W3082445411","W3086370343","W3103475369","W3109512724","W3163093040","W3183572393","W3188266517","W3197605447","W3200776371","W3202633869","W3203791779","W3213554666","W4205996112","W4206293679","W4206311101","W4206591569","W4214825345","W4221073130","W4225667306","W4233920762","W4235654752","W4251337230","W4254282282","W4300925890"],"citations":[],"citationsCount":0,"abstract":"Digital phenotyping is a rapidly growing research field promising to transform how psychiatry measures, classifies, predicts, and explains human behavior. This article advances the social-scientific examination of digital phenotyping's epistemology and knowledge claims. Drawing on the notion of a “neuromolecular gaze” in psychiatry since the 1960s, it suggests that digital phenotyping concerns a new psychiatric gaze—the “digital gaze.” Rather than privileging neuromolecular explanations, the digital gaze privileges the “deep” physiological, behavioral, and social “truths” afforded by digital technologies and big data. The article interrogates two concepts directing the digital gaze: “digital phenotype” and “digital biomarkers.” Both concepts make explicit an epistemic link between “the digital” and “the biological.” The article examines the soundness and construction of this link to, first, offer a “reality check” of digital phenotyping's claims and, second, more clearly delineate and demarcate the digital gaze. It argues there is evidence of significant mis- and overstatements about digital phenotyping's basis in biology, including in much-hyped psychiatric digital biomarker research. Rather than driving the biologization of digital traces, as some have suggested, digital mental health phenotyping so far seems mainly concerned with physiological, behavioral, and social processes that can be surveilled by means of digital devices.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4200556581","numberInSourceReferences":4,"doi":"10.2196/PREPRINTS.35722","title":"Scoping review of digital biomarker-based studies (Preprint)","authors":[{"id":"A2798299525","orcid":null,"LN":"Motahari-Nezhad","FN":"Hossein"},{"id":"A4288335078","orcid":"0000-0002-6658-8164","LN":"Fgaier","FN":"Meriem"},{"id":"A4353299567","orcid":null,"LN":"Abid","FN":"Mohamed"},{"id":"A4353572542","orcid":null,"LN":"Péntek","FN":"Márta"},{"id":"A4355487735","orcid":null,"LN":"Gulácsi","FN":"László"},{"id":"A4357222592","orcid":null,"LN":"Zrubka","FN":"Zsombor"}],"year":2021,"references":["W1870903963","W1911705068","W2163223903","W2300243664","W2559820773","W2732150368","W2759174152","W2801834301","W2890655815","W2891378911","W2891468982","W2892647900","W2894098752","W2896647471","W2900339363","W2900851515","W2907230884","W2909145757","W2913259558","W2913335608","W2914234753","W2920954231","W2921722819","W2922526452","W2922785603","W2925900847","W2927358919","W2934144495","W2941663933","W2944340769","W2944492170","W2945344227","W2949338465","W2951872033","W2955585842","W2956093111","W2957896895","W2962810347","W2963957222","W2964144124","W2966673978","W2967656293","W2968807426","W2972306940","W2973058407","W2974858420","W2977261591","W2980252214","W2985306752","W2985758825","W2986026434","W2990408414","W2991049755","W2991065351","W2994974106","W2995747970","W2999537293","W3000141445","W3004291740","W3005494663","W3008640586","W3012029195","W3012067971","W3015620020","W3016231786","W3016341785","W3017761351","W3024909861","W3025463389","W3025555717","W3032766692","W3037333879","W3040890538","W3042750741","W3042889393","W3044761805","W3046277417","W3046468311","W3047026678","W3048796005","W3080917251","W3082897316","W3084154880","W3087846344","W3088108321","W3089965568","W3094734549","W3104879713","W3112278578","W3133762983","W3153796453","W3160353426","W3181959214","W3183633169","W3201788237","W3208845186","W4234473732","W4249004226","W4294214983"],"citations":[],"citationsCount":0,"abstract":"<sec> <title>BACKGROUND</title> Sensors and digital devices have revolutionized the process of measuring, collecting, and storing health data. Digital biomarkers are defined as objective, quantifiable, physiological, and behavioral measures contained in digital devices that are portable, wearable, implantable, or digestible. The clinical utility of digital biomarkers is being supported by an increasing body of research. </sec> <sec> <title>OBJECTIVE</title> The present study intends to investigate the scope of digital biomarker-based systematic reviews. </sec> <sec> <title>METHODS</title> The current scoping review was organized using PRISMA-ScR. Limiting the search to English full-text systematic reviews of digital biomarkers that included at least one randomized controlled trial involving a human population and reporting changes in participants' health status. PubMed and the Cochrane library were searched. Separately, two reviewers screened and selected records. In addition, the qualified papers' reference lists were examined for additional reviews. The World Health Organization's (WHO) classification systems for diseases (ICD-11), health interventions (ICHI), and bodily functions (ICF) were used to classify populations, interventions, and outcomes. </sec> <sec> <title>RESULTS</title> 66 reviews met the inclusion criteria, mostly were published by authors from the United States of America (18, 27.28%). The most prevalent disease areas were Circulatory System (n=12, 18.18%) and External Causes (n=12, 18.18%). 27 and 23 interventions were connected to health-related behaviors and the circulatory system, respectively. Looking after one's health (physical activity) (n=22) and demographic changes (mortality) (n=19) were the most commonly reported outcomes. A substantial number of digital devices, mostly in the form of wearables (n=39/66, 59.09 %) were employed as interventions (n=43/66, 65.15 %).

Digital technologies to aid the earlier detection of dementia are approaching market. These include traditional cognitive screening tools presented on mobile devices, smartphone native applications, passive data collection from wearable, in-home and in-car sensors, as well as machine learning techniques applied to clinic and imaging data. It has been suggested that earlier detection and diagnosis may help patients plan for their future, achieve a better quality of life, and access clinical trials and possible future disease modifying treatments. In this review, we explore whether digital tools for the early detection of dementia can or should be deployed, by assessing them against the principles of ethical screening programs. We conclude that while the importance of dementia as a health problem is unquestionable, significant challenges remain. There is no available treatment which improves the prognosis of diagnosed disease. Progression from early-stage disease to dementia is neither given nor currently predictable. Available technologies are generally not both minimally invasive and highly accurate. Digital deployment risks exacerbating health inequalities due to biased training data and inequity in digital access. Finally, the acceptability of early dementia detection is not established, and resources would be needed to ensure follow-up and support for those flagged by any new system. We conclude that early dementia detection deployed at scale via digital technologies does not meet standards for a screening program and we offer recommendations for moving toward an ethical mode of implementation.

Beyond their use as interventions, DHTs also serve as a vehicle for real-world data collection to characterize patients, their care journeys, and responses to other clinical interventions. There is a need to comprehensively map the evidence—across all conditions and technology types—on DHT use for measuring patient outcomes in the real world. </sec> <sec> <title>OBJECTIVE</title> To investigate the use of DHT for measuring real-world clinical outcomes using patient-generated data. </sec> <sec> <title>METHODS</title> We conducted this systematic scoping review in accordance with Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. Detailed eligibility criteria documented in a pre-registered protocol informed a search strategy for the included databases: MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL, Cochrane (CENTRAL), Embase, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the EU Clinical Trials Register. We considered studies in which digital health data were collected, passively and/or actively, from patients with any specified health condition outside of clinical visits. Categories for key concepts, such as DHT type and analytic applications, were established where needed. Following screening and full-text review, data were extracted and analyzed using predefined fields, and findings were reported in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR. </sec> <sec> <title>RESULTS</title> The search strategy identified a total of 11,015 publications, with 7,308 records once duplicates and reviews were removed. After screening and full text review, 510 studies were included for extraction. These studies encompassed 169 different diseases and conditions over 20 therapeutic areas and 44 countries. DHTs used for mental health and addictions research (n = 111) were most prevalent. The most common type of DHT, smartphone/mobile apps, were reflected in approximately half of all studies (n = 250). Most studies used only one DHT (n = 346); however, the majority of digital technologies used were able to collect more than one type of data, with the most common being physiological (n = 189), clinical symptoms (n = 188), and behavioural (n = 171). Overall, there has been real growth in the depth and breadth of evidence, number of DHT types, and use of artificial intelligence and advanced analytics over time. </sec> <sec> <title>CONCLUSIONS</title> This scoping review offers a comprehensive view of the variety of types of technology, data, collection methods, analytic approaches, and therapeutic applications within this growing body of evidence. To unlock the full potential of DHT for measuring health outcomes and capturing of digital biomarkers, there is a need for more rigorous research that goes beyond technology validation to demonstrate whether robust real-world data can be reliably captured from patients in their daily life, and whether its capture improves patient outcomes. The present study provides a valuable repository of DHT studies to inform subsequent research by health care providers, policymakers, and the life sciences industry. </sec>","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4290744477","numberInSourceReferences":14,"doi":"10.3389/FPSYT.2022.899080","title":"Associations of digital neuro-signatures with molecular and neuroimaging measures of brain resilience: The altoida large cohort study","authors":[{"id":"A4338865147","orcid":null,"LN":"Seixas","FN":"Azizi","affil":"University of Miami (US)"},{"id":"A2767129367","orcid":null,"LN":"Rajabli","FN":"Farid","affil":"Dr. John T.

To address this critical gap, the primary goal of the current study is to investigate whether a digital neuro signature (DNS-br) biomarker predicted global cognitive functioning and change over time relative among cognitively impaired and cognitive healthy older adults. The secondary goal is to compare the effect size of the DNS-br biomarker on global cognitive functioning compared to traditional imaging and genomic biomarkers. The tertiary goal is to investigate which demographic and clinical factors predicted DNS-br in cognitively impaired and cognitively healthy older adults. Methods We conducted two experiments (Study A and Study B) to assess DNS for brain resilience (DNS-br) against the established FDG-PET brain imaging signature for brain resilience, based on a 10 min digital cognitive assessment tool. Study A was a semi-naturalistic observational study that included 29 participants, age 65+, with mild to moderate mild cognitive impairment and AD diagnosis. Study B was also a semi-naturalistic observational multicenter study which included 496 participants (213 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 283 cognitively healthy controls (HC), a total of 525 participants—cognitively healthy ( n = 283) or diagnosed with MCI ( n = 213) or AD ( n = 29). Results DNS-br total score and majority of the 11 DNS-br neurocognitive subdomain scores were significantly associated with FDG-PET resilience signature, PIB ratio, cerebral gray matter and white matter volume after adjusting for multiple testing. DNS-br total score predicts cognitive impairment for the 80+ individuals in the Altoida large cohort study. We identified a significant interaction between the DNS-br total score and time, indicating that participants with higher DNS-br total score or FDG-PET in the resilience signature would show less cognitive decline over time. Conclusion Our findings highlight that a digital biomarker predicted cognitive functioning and change, which established biomarkers are unable to reliably do. Our findings also offer possible etiologies of MCI and AD, where education did not protect against cognitive decline.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4376104934","numberInSourceReferences":8,"doi":"10.1016/J.BIOS.2023.115387","title":"The convergence of traditional and digital biomarkers through AI-assisted biosensing: A new era in translational diagnostics?","authors":[{"id":"A4318209492","orcid":null,"LN":"Arya","FN":"Sagar S.","affil":"Khalifa University of Science and Technology (AE)"},{"id":"A4376664896","orcid":null,"LN":"Dias","FN":"Sofia B.","affil":"Khalifa University of Science and Technology (AE), University of Lisbon (PT)"},{"id":"A4376664897","orcid":null,"LN":"Jelinek","FN":"Herbert F.","affil":"Khalifa University of Science and Technology (AE)"},{"id":"A4361668101","orcid":null,"LN":"Hadjileontiadis","FN":"Leontios J.","affil":"Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (GR), Khalifa University of Science and Technology (AE)"},{"id":"A2618203409","orcid":"0000-0002-7980-4073","LN":"Pappa","FN":"Anna-Maria","affil":"Khalifa University of Science and Technology (AE), University of Cambridge (GB)"}],"year":2023,"journal":"Biosensors and Bioelectronics (Elsevier BV)","references":["W822149926","W1034491903","W1968864692","W1980541833","W2000671183","W2005890771","W2006301411","W2014568566","W2017141557","W2057705353","W2087867074","W2131861212","W2143180936","W2158502994","W2170589179","W2191247297","W2215415349","W2222292469","W2266175888","W2327547544","W2460932277","W2464637858","W2524967876","W2551734833","W2561981131","W2566161284","W2574861430","W2582718788","W2587781586","W2606585248","W2608999297","W2625272325","W2626906048","W2734983395","W2738137475","W2746143613","W2749442893","W2750686414","W2757547275","W2766250302","W2771027085","W2773381949","W2774100359","W2782367231","W2783338612","W2790155709","W2791375536","W2791642349","W2793756233","W2801082204","W2803173254","W2803176146","W2804026402","W2807561669","W2807893746","W2809514465","W2886901509","W2887226015","W2887923311","W2889883444","W2890122619","W2901330522","W2901946084","W2902624216","W2903287413","W2905939891","W2914059200","W2915843262","W2917386416","W2921675148","W2929430482","W2938816672","W2946381164","W2954884276","W2955961229","W2963557522","W2965481926","W2966682523","W2967444033","W2968807426","W2972125650","W2973178301","W2973482184","W2976952765","W2980189126","W2980823878","W2981153486","W2987712342","W2989537165","W2991400521","W2993262800","W2996154224","W2998401461","W2998557912","W3000324140","W3001638923","W3004885588","W3006206442","W3006682340","W3008929726","W3009327388","W3011863123","W3012163988","W3014298370","W3015641462","W3018629672","W3023358431","W3029144285","W3030588587","W3038947152","W3039593752","W3041792363","W3042750741","W3044049599","W3048679509","W3049022755","W3049758936","W3083764457","W3092584260","W3093087415","W3100709371","W3109103478","W3110857070","W3111804278","W3118546024","W3119276753","W3124474911","W3125546308","W3132782516","W3133540154","W3142312189","W3153157713","W3157748052","W3167380600","W3174727054","W3175119564","W3180431294","W3197051898","W3198590488","W3202835744","W3208122070","W3208230990","W3208744682","W3209179172","W3209534602","W3210236695","W3212011337","W3213590169","W3214688473","W3216931256","W4200268186","W4200365974","W4205385134","W4206591569","W4206955452","W4210642226","W4211044837","W4212769765","W4212964804","W4214716672","W4214862284","W4220933338","W4220968751","W4225011340","W4225154013","W4225589542","W4280499268","W4281767622","W4281776900","W4282053000","W4284988514","W4285590410","W4286245995","W4286545304","W4287851275","W4289598217","W4294487019","W4295222506","W4307728468","W4308616060","W4313488048","W4313546446","W4315853731","W4318207602","W4318317727","W4361279451"],"citations":[],"citationsCount":0,"abstract":"Advances in consumer electronics, alongside the fields of microfluidics and nanotechnology have brought to the fore low-cost wearable/portable smart devices. Although numerous smart devices that track digital biomarkers have been successfully translated from bench-to-bedside, only a few follow the same fate when it comes to track traditional biomarkers. Current practices still involve laboratory-based tests, followed by blood collection, conducted in a clinical setting as they require trained personnel and specialized equipment. In fact, real-time, passive/active and robust sensing of physiological and behavioural data from patients that can feed artificial intelligence (AI)-based models can significantly improve decision-making, diagnosis and treatment at the point-of-procedure, by circumventing conventional methods of sampling, and in person investigation by expert pathologists, who are scarce in developing countries. This review brings together conventional and digital biomarker sensing through portable and autonomous miniaturized devices. We first summarise the technological advances in each field vs the current clinical practices and we conclude by merging the two worlds of traditional and digital biomarkers through AI/ML technologies to improve patient diagnosis and treatment. The fundamental role, limitations and prospects of AI in realizing this potential and enhancing the existing technologies to facilitate the development and clinical translation of “point-of-care” (POC) diagnostics is finally showcased.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4378746606","numberInSourceReferences":15,"doi":"10.1007/S13311-023-01384-2","title":"Machine Learning in Clinical Trials: A Primer with Applications to Neurology","authors":[{"id":"A4370824713","orcid":null,"LN":"Miller","FN":"Matthew I."},{"id":"A4284483073","orcid":"0000-0002-6590-8365","LN":"Shih","FN":"Ludy C"},{"id":"A797868563","orcid":"0000-0002-5312-8644","LN":"Kolachalama","FN":"Vijaya B."}],"year":2023,"journal":"Neurotherapeutics (Springer Science+Business Media)","references":["W32516901","W32995764","W128448889","W1504356022","W1582456500","W1909740415","W1963966429","W1966516148","W1966716734","W1981976602","W1985053342","W1997718099","W2004910511","W2017059429","W2031263002","W2047150424","W2067395123","W2080515294","W2082704080","W2088794999","W2089377668","W2099474155","W2112157145","W2116417366","W2122111042","W2137983211","W2138595885","W2143891888","W2150291618","W2155653793","W2169818249","W2171443468","W2191082636","W2196555070","W2222234881","W2238616915","W2291981771","W2298338128","W2329659234","W2336810911","W2438733969","W2483962956","W2557738935","W2581082771","W2590861467","W2618530766","W2737897751","W2748018021","W2762473351","W2766736793","W2772246919","W2777270043","W2802576723","W2803176146","W2806757728","W2895763047","W2896893468","W2900817205","W2904730732","W2906295032","W2908201961","W2911661483","W2911964244","W2915292867","W2917347002","W2934399013","W2945068453","W2945893512","W2948551797","W2955325220","W2962411443","W2962858109","W2964135755","W2965564384","W2966630186","W2969881216","W2971998890","W2973136764","W2978823957","W2984432074","W2999365564","W2999615587","W3004883806","W3006513902","W3007877850","W3009049896","W3013252960","W3015565366","W3021833419","W3022623176","W3023079706","W3025989244","W3028146832","W3034275230","W3035833355","W3042689112","W3042750741","W3043725192","W3046113390","W3080337117","W3083804794","W3084438218","W3086667591","W3089819255","W3092667344","W3096831136","W3098949126","W3101840241","W3113016715","W3118361918","W3121368818","W3135855542","W3136907493","W3138368401","W3140760072","W3143784018","W3144927927","W3156027765","W3158140473","W3159064895","W3160285689","W3160780501","W3162797634","W3166254754","W3166593234","W3169649689","W3170349722","W3181959214","W3184243839","W3191484051","W3192858838","W3194864487","W3197051898","W3202623877","W3209901185","W3216225969","W4200238116","W4200305004","W4200603057","W4206591569","W4207051106","W4213019189","W4213237753","W4229440827","W4230532893","W4244030128","W4247509274","W4283156058","W4283159449","W4291023040","W4295951577","W4297957988","W4302036486","W4309409155","W4317499915","W4318931874","W4319083882","W4327810158"],"citations":[],"citationsCount":0,"abstract":"We reviewed foundational concepts in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) and discussed ways in which these methodologies may be employed to enhance progress in clinical trials and research, with particular attention to applications in the design, conduct, and interpretation of clinical trials for neurologic diseases.

The effectiveness of predictive techniques to monitor depression is limited, given the idiosyncratic nature of depression symptoms and the limited availability of objectively labelled depression sensor-driven behaviour. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of using unsupervised anomaly detection methods to monitor the fluctuations of mental health and its severity. Informed by literature, we created a mobile application that collects acknowledged data streams that can be indicative of depression. We recruited 11 participants for a 1-month field study. More specifically, we monitored participants’ mobility, overall smartphone interactions, and surrounding ambient noise. The participants provided three self-reports: Big five personality traits, sleep and depression. Our results suggest that digital markers, combined with anomaly detection methods are useful to flag changes in human behaviour over time; thus, enabling mobile just-in-time interventions for in-the-wild assistance.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4285734290","numberInSourceReferences":10,"doi":"10.2196/PREPRINTS.41042","title":"Digital biomarker-based interventions: A systematic review of systematic reviews (Preprint)","authors":[{"id":"A4269858515","orcid":"0000-0002-1028-4460","LN":"Motahari-Nezhad","FN":"Hossein"},{"id":"A4310991593","orcid":"0000-0002-5502-8743","LN":"Al-Abdulkarim","FN":"Hana"},{"id":"A4288335078","orcid":"0000-0002-6658-8164","LN":"Fgaier","FN":"Meriem"},{"id":"A4288335079","orcid":"0000-0002-5737-7752","LN":"Abid","FN":"Mohamed Mahdi"},{"id":"A2113963846","orcid":"0000-0001-9636-6012","LN":"Péntek","FN":"Márta"},{"id":"A686246424","orcid":"0000-0002-9285-8746","LN":"Gulácsi","FN":"László"},{"id":"A2468441111","orcid":"0000-0002-1992-6087","LN":"Zrubka","FN":"Zsombor"}],"year":2022,"references":["W1259937382","W1598602811","W2009326492","W2011992630","W2033585778","W2090132603","W2093043874","W2109346853","W2111011000","W2135400982","W2161810494","W2163223903","W2164586769","W2165010366","W2271003896","W2559820773","W2567362164","W2756578555","W2759174152","W2789662105","W2801834301","W2802822747","W2804964104","W2838937885","W2887033287","W2890655815","W2891468982","W2892647900","W2896423780","W2907230884","W2913259558","W2913335608","W2921623465","W2922526452","W2932838904","W2941438674","W2945609423","W2945960024","W2946387158","W2947531909","W2949338465","W2963957222","W2964144124","W2966673978","W2968807426","W2980252214","W2985758825","W2994974106","W3004291740","W3016231786","W3017761351","W3022995359","W3025463389","W3025555717","W3038067560","W3044761805","W3046277417","W3088108321","W3089965568","W3092463840","W3112278578","W3140442677","W3146142859","W3153526127","W3153796453","W3161759293","W4212965831","W4214480870","W4225999312","W4233204565","W4249004226","W4283512627","W4294214983","W4299627282"],"citations":[],"citationsCount":0,"abstract":"<sec> <title>BACKGROUND</title> The introduction of new medical technologies such as sensors has accelerated the process of collecting patient data for relevant clinical decisions, which has led to the introduction of a new technology known as digital biomarkers. </sec> <sec> <title>OBJECTIVE</title> This study aims to assess the methodological quality and quality of evidence from meta-analyses of digital biomarker-based interventions. </sec> <sec> <title>METHODS</title> This study follows the PRISMA guideline for reporting systematic reviews, including original English publications of systematic reviews reporting meta-analyses of clinical outcomes (efficacy and safety endpoints) of digital biomarker-based interventions compared with alternative interventions without digital biomarkers.

These sensors measure the activity, housing conditions, feed intake, and health of farm animals. With traditional methods, the data from farm animals and their environment can be collected intermittently. However, with the advancement of wearable and non-invasive sensing tools, these measurements can be made in real-time for continuous quantitation relating to clinical biomarkers, resilience indicators, and behavioral predictors. The digital phenotyping of humans has drawn enormous attention recently due to its medical significance, but much research is still needed for the digital phenotyping of farm animals. Implications from human studies show great promise for the application of digital phenotyping technology in modern livestock farming, but these technologies must be directly applied to animals to understand their true capacities. Due to species-specific traits, certain technologies required to assess phenotypes need to be tailored efficiently and accurately. Such devices allow for the collection of information that can better inform farmers on aspects of animal welfare and production that need improvement. By explicitly addressing farm animals’ individual physiological and mental (affective states) needs, sensor-based digital phenotyping has the potential to serve as an effective intervention platform. Future research is warranted for the design and development of digital phenotyping technology platforms that create shared data standards, metrics, and repositories.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3111385962","numberInSourceReferences":9,"doi":"10.1002/JAC5.1382","title":"Digital health implications for clinical pharmacists services: A primer on the current landscape and future concerns","authors":[{"id":"A1822375682","orcid":"0000-0002-6914-0218","LN":"Aungst","FN":"Timothy Dy","affil":"MCPHS University (US)"},{"id":"A4341923766","orcid":null,"LN":"Franzese","FN":"Christopher J.","affil":"Matchstick, LLC, Boonton, New Jersey, USA"},{"id":"A4357535459","orcid":null,"LN":"Kim","FN":"Yoona","affil":"Arine, Inc., San Francisco, California, USA"}],"year":2020,"journal":"JACCP: journal of the American College of Clinical Pharmacy (Wiley)","references":["W2042409343","W2068382224","W2141795416","W2145909170","W2165530491","W2213926659","W2339888523","W2560529580","W2573003069","W2604186734","W2625326488","W2650932744","W2767543826","W2775554754","W2783521078","W2791577102","W2791600159","W2792631875","W2793848612","W2795881110","W2799837895","W2803176146","W2807447523","W2887366908","W2889669989","W2911737149","W2913590692","W2917347002","W2921623465","W2927860118","W2941663933","W2941936861","W2944361236","W2945276691","W2945818993","W2957543651","W2968807426","W2978113944","W2982499424","W2996035929","W3003343618","W3003592023","W3010714726","W3014972808","W3021911090","W4236196980"],"citations":[],"citationsCount":7,"abstract":"Digital health has seen a rapid expansion across the health care space, impacting many health professions with recent advances in technology.

Algorithms that process these data and inform digital diagnostics are typically developed using training and test sets generated from multiple repeated measures collected across a set of individuals. However, the inclusion of repeated measurements is not always appropriately taken into account in the analytical evaluations of predictive performance. The assignment of repeated measurements from each individual to both the training and the test sets (“record-wise” data split) is a common practice and can lead to massive underestimation of the prediction error due to the presence of “identity confounding.” In essence, these models learn to identify subjects, in addition to diagnostic signal. Here, we present a method that can be used to effectively calculate the amount of identity confounding learned by classifiers developed using a record-wise data split. By applying this method to several real datasets, we demonstrate that identity confounding is a serious issue in digital health studies and that record-wise data splits for machine learning- based applications need to be avoided.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3026426657","numberInSourceReferences":17,"doi":"10.3233/JPD-202006","title":"Deep Phenotyping of Parkinson’s Disease","authors":[{"id":"A4356611114","orcid":null,"LN":"Dorsey","FN":"E.

While advances in genetics, imaging, and molecular biology have improved our understanding of the underlying biology of Parkinson's disease (PD), clinical phenotyping of PD still relies primarily on history and physical examination. These subjective, episodic, categorical assessments are valuable for diagnosis and care but have left gaps in our understanding of the PD phenotype. Sensors can provide objective, continuous, real-world data about the PD clinical phenotype, increase our knowledge of its pathology, enhance evaluation of therapies, and ultimately, improve patient care. In this paper, we explore the concept of deep phenotyping-the comprehensive assessment of a condition using multiple clinical, biological, genetic, imaging, and sensor-based tools-for PD. We discuss the rationale for, outline current approaches to, identify benefits and limitations of, and consider future directions for deep clinical phenotyping.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3029881688","numberInSourceReferences":20,"doi":"10.1038/S41746-020-0288-5","title":"Sex and gender differences and biases in artificial intelligence for biomedicine and healthcare","authors":[{"id":"A2121958502","orcid":"0000-0003-4982-4716","LN":"Cirillo","FN":"Davide","affil":"Barcelona Supercomputing Center (ES)"},{"id":"A2501425544","orcid":"0000-0002-1514-0431","LN":"Catuara-Solarz","FN":"Silvina","affil":"Women's Brain Project (CH), Telefonica Research and Development (ES)"},{"id":"A3030060592","orcid":null,"LN":"Morey","FN":"Czuee","affil":"Women's Brain Project (CH), Wega Informatik AG, Basel, Switzerland"},{"id":"A4349699620","orcid":null,"LN":"Guney","FN":"Emre","affil":"Pompeu Fabra University (ES)"},{"id":"A4351730546","orcid":null,"LN":"Subirats","FN":"Laia","affil":"Centre Tecnologic De Telecomunicacions De Catalunya (ES), Open University of Catalonia (ES)"},{"id":"A2709897408","orcid":null,"LN":"Mellino","FN":"Simona","affil":"Women's Brain Project (CH)"},{"id":"A3031689662","orcid":null,"LN":"Gigante","FN":"Annalisa","affil":"Women's Brain Project (CH)"},{"id":"A4355598741","orcid":null,"LN":"Valencia","FN":"Alfonso","affil":"Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats (ES), Barcelona Supercomputing Center (ES), Institut Català de Ciències del Clima (ES)"},{"id":"A3030473962","orcid":null,"LN":"Rementeria","FN":"María José","affil":"Barcelona Supercomputing Center (ES)"},{"id":"A2837656970","orcid":"0000-0002-4021-3129","LN":"Chadha","FN":"Antonella Santuccione","affil":"Women's Brain Project (CH)"},{"id":"A325222109","orcid":null,"LN":"Mavridis","FN":"Nikolaos","affil":"Women's Brain Project (CH), Interactive Robots and Media Laboratory (IRML), Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates"}],"year":2020,"references":["W1518469230","W1569397376","W1584793850","W1971557336","W1978594384","W1996579832","W1997185504","W1999105610","W2007180473","W2008158645","W2011195206","W2019138349","W2019789239","W2025403586","W2033074509","W2036594590","W2040262898","W2045019335","W2059373137","W2063170297","W2086632167","W2087262651","W2087547434","W2093065590","W2100960835","W2108475224","W2115683309","W2117344524","W2121841953","W2126276057","W2126828346","W2131093315","W2133574018","W2139875525","W2139998668","W2140038023","W2149280200","W2153116947","W2153243792","W2154677576","W2155981773","W2164364358","W2164410015","W2165111926","W2169597261","W2172180370","W2193493665","W2194366276","W2270987730","W2293723806","W2341028609","W2347156995","W2404901863","W2471654745","W2525035644","W2531072432","W2552997063","W2588377224","W2588917609","W2604860225","W2610509910","W2622927176","W2623779865","W2671308999","W2737066923","W2740983644","W2741213675","W2752747624","W2752766789","W2760255222","W2766712350","W2769358515","W2769597399","W2769742875","W2775553766","W2781752134","W2789955061","W2790179710","W2791600159","W2798149087","W2798203717","W2801264239","W2801834301","W2802105481","W2803356376","W2806112435","W2806864282","W2810454451","W2834941082","W2883457138","W2886281300","W2886342482","W2886788613","W2887377515","W2902802452","W2905322176","W2906199739","W2914514892","W2917272172","W2917347002","W2920041378","W2921623465","W2923649002","W2924050599","W2943742161","W2947175323","W2947180809","W2948998194","W2950783154","W2950888501","W2952638532","W2955115809","W2955662239","W2957285709","W2963116854","W2981869278","W4231944115","W4251915302","W4254505967","W4255414603"],"citations":[],"citationsCount":157,"abstract":"Abstract Precision Medicine implies a deep understanding of inter-individual differences in health and disease that are due to genetic and environmental factors. To acquire such understanding there is a need for the implementation of different types of technologies based on artificial intelligence (AI) that enable the identification of biomedically relevant patterns, facilitating progress towards individually tailored preventative and therapeutic interventions. Despite the significant scientific advances achieved so far, most of the currently used biomedical AI technologies do not account for bias detection. Furthermore, the design of the majority of algorithms ignore the sex and gender dimension and its contribution to health and disease differences among individuals. Failure in accounting for these differences will generate sub-optimal results and produce mistakes as well as discriminatory outcomes. In this review we examine the current sex and gender gaps in a subset of biomedical technologies used in relation to Precision Medicine. In addition, we provide recommendations to optimize their utilization to improve the global health and disease landscape and decrease inequalities.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4313245598","numberInSourceReferences":18,"doi":"10.3390/GENES14010063","title":"Integrating Rehabilomics into the Multi-Omics Approach in the Management of Multiple Sclerosis: The Way for Precision Medicine?","authors":[{"id":"A4357223350","orcid":null,"LN":"Bonnechère","FN":"Bruno","affil":"Hasselt University (BE)"}],"year":2022,"journal":"Genes (MDPI)","references":["W91108901","W1836273607","W1871950814","W2048759677","W2060559864","W2075906146","W2098661447","W2113347439","W2122545833","W2135831208","W2142577589","W2276765849","W2297186297","W2305134083","W2344476233","W2344609651","W2406318228","W2489222638","W2528793084","W2532031923","W2558115423","W2566609818","W2573003069","W2593802618","W2593866534","W2594215242","W2594894796","W2618317899","W2624915721","W2695618445","W2732150368","W2734616065","W2740711073","W2744682287","W2749718288","W2763518143","W2765429604","W2792858861","W2795307842","W2802925146","W2805370401","W2810512893","W2877846228","W2883041645","W2883660857","W2895656046","W2895845951","W2899046125","W2899153395","W2903458588","W2906666473","W2909668868","W2911529483","W2912584875","W2946502346","W2947528877","W2967871861","W2968807426","W2970686316","W2981477552","W2982474113","W2983140538","W2994833293","W3003192283","W3006252679","W3011366954","W3011616854","W3017230581","W3024384408","W3041644183","W3048083926","W3088882399","W3108546277","W3112212292","W3122589086","W3129723041","W3130847894","W3131957723","W3133027118","W3135599602","W3159064895","W3161348055","W3161744819","W3171153471","W3175147800","W3191473449","W3193421084","W3200941727","W3201843376","W3203003270","W3208122070","W3210740912","W3211053200","W3213283589","W4213344128","W4220997146","W4223599312","W4225425510","W4225751944","W4254495319","W4282960783","W4283020037","W4283312379","W4293512187","W4294189067","W4307429575","W4308512120"],"citations":[],"citationsCount":0,"abstract":"Over recent years, significant improvements have been made in the understanding of (epi)genetics and neuropathophysiological mechanisms driving the different forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). For example, the role and importance of the bidirectional communications between the brain and the gut—also referred to as the gut-brain axis—in the pathogenesis of MS is receiving increasing interest in recent years and is probably one of the most promising areas of research for the management of people with MS. However, despite these important advances, it must be noted that these data are not—yet—used in rehabilitation. Neurorehabilitation is a cornerstone of MS patient management, and there are many techniques available to clinicians and patients, including technology-supported rehabilitation. In this paper, we will discuss how new findings on the gut microbiome could help us to better understand how rehabilitation can improve motor and cognitive functions. We will also see how the data gathered during the rehabilitation can help to get a better diagnosis of the patients. Finally, we will discuss how these new techniques can better guide rehabilitation to lead to precision rehabilitation and ultimately increase the quality of patient care.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3186934007","numberInSourceReferences":19,"doi":"10.1016/B978-0-12-820493-1.00017-9","title":"Cardiovascular translational biomarkers: translational aspects of hypertension, atherosclerosis, and heart failure in drug development in the digital era","authors":[{"id":"A4342839692","orcid":null,"LN":"Degenfeld","FN":"Georges von","affil":"iATROS, Head of Clinical Development & Chief Medical Officer, Munich, Germany"},{"id":"A2889631235","orcid":"0000-0001-6413-7864","LN":"Truebel","FN":"Hubert","affil":"AiCuris AG, Head of Clinical Development & Chief Medical Officer, Wuppertal, Germany"}],"year":2021,"journal":"Elsevier eBooks","references":["W1592733321","W1887840190","W1943561246","W1963794481","W1970445984","W1970824464","W1975175673","W1975582897","W1982033642","W1990525060","W2002221379","W2003171726","W2003276740","W2004153415","W2007424272","W2007825565","W2008522456","W2015754189","W2018657443","W2018804632","W2025149959","W2030343121","W2032359266","W2036632357","W2045479790","W2050476654","W2050856560","W2061136707","W2061595855","W2061624989","W2064382554","W2066228805","W2071962149","W2072380594","W2084628164","W2085943260","W2087863216","W2088128173","W2102172333","W2102814494","W2102852135","W2105924650","W2107131489","W2113934014","W2114942701","W2117185007","W2119293458","W2125431201","W2126125759","W2131829313","W2151369102","W2153760303","W2156433522","W2162422100","W2164123970","W2166520734","W2167666858","W2292493149","W2401962080","W2508578541","W2604051987","W2611131415","W2613443288","W2624915721","W2748054518","W2765850529","W2789662105","W2792897292","W2795231043","W2803063272","W2806176708","W2809736698","W2883029808","W2884896214","W2893267426","W2908216172","W2908523170","W2909249787","W2921428883","W2938288013","W2944361236","W2945262004","W2947100277","W2962169757","W2963953373","W2963957222","W2965520043","W2968807426","W2972304897","W2987985090","W2994053604","W2994548612","W2994944721","W2995688126","W3009223317","W3011371150","W3012183387","W3014508600","W3025563006","W3026454954","W3027010397","W3029847683","W3030230007","W3033650763","W3034270991","W3042735003","W4211079492","W4247767945"],"citations":[],"citationsCount":0,"abstract":"Biomarkers are essential in the development of drugs against cardiovascular diseases.
