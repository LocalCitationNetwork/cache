That conclusion, however, depends upon the validity of scores from measures of physical activity among the MS population. This study evaluated the validity of scores from two self-report surveys, a pedometer, and an accelerometer and during seven days of free-living conditions among individuals with MS.Participants were 30 individuals (28 females, two males) with an established definite diagnosis of MS. The participants wore a pedometer and a single-axis accelerometer during the waking hours of a 7-day period.

Strong linear associations were found between accelerometer activity counts and energy expenditure, and the magnitude did not differ between MS and controls for both accelerometer models. The mean slopes of the linear relationships were steeper in persons with MS than controls and resulted in distinct cut-points for MVPA based on accelerometer counts for persons with MS and controls.

The study sought to determine if body-worn sensors could detect differences in balance and gait between people with MS with normal walking speeds and healthy controls. Thirty-one MS and twenty-eight age- and sex-matched control subjects were tested using body-worn sensors both during quiet stance and gait (Timed Up and Go test, TUG). Results were compared to stopwatch-timed measures. Stopwatch durations of the TUG and Timed 25 Foot Walk tests were not significantly different between groups. However, during quiet stance with eyes closed, people with MS had significantly greater sway acceleration amplitude than controls (p=0.02). During gait, people with MS had greater trunk angular range of motion in roll (medio-lateral flexion, p=0.017) and yaw (axial rotation, p=0.026) planes. Turning duration through 180° was also longer in MS (p=0.031). Thus, body-worn motion sensors detected mobility differences between MS and healthy controls when traditional timed tests could not. This portable technology provides objective and quantitative mobility data previously not obtainable in the clinic, and may prove a useful outcome measure for early mobility changes in MS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2159230394","numberInSourceReferences":62,"doi":"10.1111/ANE.12036","title":"Accelerometry as a measure of walking behavior in multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Robert W.

This study compared physical activity levels between large samples of persons with mild MS and matched controls using validated measures of physical activity. Materials and methods The sample included 77 cases of MS and 77 controls matched on age, height, weight, and gender. Physical activity was assessed using five measures, namely the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ), International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), and activity counts per day, step counts per day, and time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day by accelerometry. Results There were statistically significant differences between groups in accelerometer activity counts (t = −3.87, P = 0.0001), accelerometer step counts (t = −4.29, P = 0.0001), time spent in MVPA (t = −2.39, P = 0.01), GLTEQ scores (t = −3.83, P = 0.0001), and IPAQ scores (t = −3.42, P = 0.0001). The average effect size across all five measures was d = −0.59 and indicated that persons with MS overall were moderately less physically active than the matched controls. Conclusions The primary finding was a moderate reduction in physical activity among those with MS, but the magnitude was substantially smaller than reported in a published meta-analysis. Importantly, the degree of physical inactivity can likely be overcome through the delivery of behavioral interventions for increasing physical activity and this should translate into meaningful consequences for persons with MS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2079481888","numberInSourceReferences":1,"doi":"10.1097/00005768-199704000-00014","title":"Quantitation of lower physical activity in persons with multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Alexander V.

The current investigation examined and compared the accuracy of the StepWatch activity monitor and ActiGraph model GT3X+ accelerometer for capturing steps taken during various speeds of prolonged, over-ground ambulation in persons with MS who had mild, moderate, and severe disability.Sixty-three persons with MS underwent a neurological examination for generation of an EDSS score and undertook two trials of walking on the GAITRite electronic walkway. Participants were fitted with accelerometers, and undertook three modified six-minute walk (6MW) tests that were interspersed with 10-15 minutes of rest. The first 6MW was undertaken at a comfortable walking speed (CWS), and the two remaining 6MW tests were undertaken above (faster walking speed; FWS) or below (slower walking speed; SWS) the participant's CWS. The actual number of steps taken was counted through direct observation using hand-tally counters.The StepWatch activity monitor (99.8%-99.9%) and ActiGraph model GT3X+ accelerometer (95.6%-97.4%) both demonstrated highly accurate measurement of steps taken under CWS and FWS conditions. The StepWatch had better accuracy (99.0%) than the ActiGraph (95.5%) in the overall sample under the SWS condition, and this was particularly apparent in those with severe disability (StepWatch: 95.7%; ActiGraph: 87.3%). The inaccuracy in measurement for the ActiGraph was associated with alterations of gait (e.g., slower gait velocity, shorter step length, wider base of support).This research will help inform the choice of accelerometer to be adopted in clinical trials of MS wherein the monitoring of free-living walking behavior is of particular value.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2021470828","numberInSourceReferences":56,"doi":"10.1007/S10439-012-0697-Y","title":"Accelerometry Reveals Differences in Gait Variability Between Patients with Multiple Sclerosis and Healthy Controls","authors":[{"id":"Jessie M.

For pathological populations, changes in variability during gait signal the presence of abnormal motor control strategies. For persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), extensive gait problems have been reported including changes in gait variability. While previous studies have focused on footfall variability, the present study used accelerometers on the trunk to measure variability during walking. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the variability of the acceleration pattern of the upper and lower trunk in PwMS compared to healthy controls. We extracted linear and nonlinear measures of gait variability from 30 s of steady state walking for 15 PwMS and 15 age-matched healthy controls. PwMS had altered variability compared to controls with greater Lyapunov exponent in the ML (p < 0.001) and AP (p < 0.001) directions, and greater frequency dispersion in the ML direction (p = 0.034). PwMS also demonstrated greater mean velocity in the ML direction (p = 0.045) and lower root mean square of acceleration in the AP direction (p = 0.040). These findings indicate that PwMS have altered structure of variability of the trunk during gait compared to healthy controls and agree with previous findings related to changes in gait variability in PwMS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2141062585","numberInSourceReferences":27,"doi":"10.1177/1352458510361357","title":"Predicting habitual walking performance in multiple sclerosis: relevance of capacity and self-report measures","authors":[{"id":"Domien Gijbels","orcid":null,"LN":"Gijbels","FN":"Domien","affil":"Hasselt University (BE)","name":"Domien Gijbels"},{"id":"Geert Alders","orcid":null,"LN":"Alders","FN":"Geert","affil":"Hasselt University (BE)","name":"Geert Alders"},{"id":"Elke Van Hoof","orcid":null,"LN":"Hoof","FN":"Elke Van","affil":"Hasselt University (BE)","name":"Elke Van Hoof"},{"id":"Caroline Charlier","orcid":null,"LN":"Charlier","FN":"Caroline","affil":"Hasselt University (BE)","name":"Caroline Charlier"},{"id":"Machteld Roelants","orcid":null,"LN":"Roelants","FN":"Machteld","affil":"Hasselt University (BE)","name":"Machteld Roelants"},{"id":"Tom Broekmans","orcid":null,"LN":"Broekmans","FN":"Tom","affil":"Hasselt University (BE)","name":"Tom Broekmans"},{"id":"Bert O.

Fifty persons with multiple sclerosis (Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS, 1.5-6.5) were tested on leg muscle strength as well as walking and balance capacity, and completed self-report indices on perceived physical functioning. Habitual walking performance, that is, the real amount of steps that is performed in the customary living environment, was registered by means of an ambulant accelerometer-based monitor during seven consecutive days. Mild (EDSS 1.5-4.0, n = 29) and moderate (EDSS 4.5-6.5, n = 21) multiple sclerosis subgroups were additionally distinguished as predictor variables and values were hypothesized to differ depending on multiple sclerosis severity and concomitant ambulatory function. Multiple regression analyses yielded a single most significant predictor for each (sub)group with other variables making no independent contribution to the variation in habitual walking performance. For the total study sample, this was the 6-Minute Walking Test (R(2) = 0.458, p < 0.01). In the mild multiple sclerosis subgroup, the 6-Minute Walking Test was again most predictive, yet to a modest degree (R(2) = 0. 187, p = 0.02). In the moderate multiple sclerosis subgroup, the 2-Minute Walking Test explained over half of the variance (R(2) = 0.532, p < 0.01). Habitual walking performance is best reflected by longer walking capacity tests. The extent to which it can be predicted based on clinical testing is larger in a multiple sclerosis patient sample with more severe walking disability. Ambulatory monitoring, however, includes aspects of community ambulation not captured in the clinic, and must be considered as an additional outcome for evaluating interventions in multiple sclerosis.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2160759647","numberInSourceReferences":75,"doi":"10.1016/J.JNS.2014.02.024","title":"Accelerometer cut-points derived during over-ground walking in persons with mild, moderate, and severe multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Brian M.

The aim of this study was to characterise gait in both laboratory and daily life conditions for a group of patients with moderate to severe ambulatory impairment due to MS. To this purpose, algorithms to detect and characterise gait from wearable inertial sensors data were also validated.Fourteen patients with MS were divided into two groups according to their disability level (EDSS 6.5-6.0 and EDSS 5.5-5.0, respectively). They performed both intermittent and continuous walking bouts (WBs) in a gait laboratory wearing waist and shank mounted inertial sensors. An algorithm (W-CWT) to estimate gait events and temporal parameters (mean and variability values) using data recorded from the waist mounted sensor (Dynaport, Mc Roberts) was tested against a reference algorithm (S-REF) based on the shank-worn sensors (OPAL, APDM). Subsequently, the accuracy of another algorithm (W-PAM) to detect and classify WBs was also tested. The validated algorithms were then used to quantify gait characteristics during short (sWB, 5-50 steps), intermediate (iWB, 51-100 steps) and long (lWB, >100 steps) daily living WBs and laboratory walking. Group means were compared using a two-way ANOVA.W-CWT compared to S-REF showed good gait event accuracy (0.05-0.10 s absolute error) and was not influenced by disability level. It slightly overestimated stride time in intermittent walking (0.012 s) and overestimated highly variability of temporal parameters in both intermittent (17.5%-58.2%) and continuous walking (11.2%-76.7%). The accuracy of W-PAM was speed-dependent and decreased with increasing disability. The ANOVA analysis showed that patients walked at a slower pace in daily living than in the laboratory. In daily living gait, all mean temporal parameters decreased as the WB duration increased. In the sWB, the patients with a lower disability score showed, on average, lower values of the temporal parameters. Variability decreased as the WB duration increased.This study validated a method to quantify walking in real life in people with MS and showed how gait characteristics estimated from short walking bouts during daily living may be the most informative to quantify level of disability and effects of interventions in patients moderately affected by MS. The study provides a robust approach for the quantification of recognised clinically relevant outcomes and an innovative perspective in the study of real life walking.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2148930341","numberInSourceReferences":51,"doi":"10.1016/J.MEDENGPHY.2011.09.005","title":"Accelerometry is associated with walking mobility, not physical activity, in persons with multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Madeline Weikert","orcid":null,"LN":"Weikert","FN":"Madeline","affil":"University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (US)","name":"Madeline Weikert"},{"id":"Yoojin Suh","orcid":null,"LN":"Suh","FN":"Yoojin","affil":"University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (US)","name":"Yoojin Suh"},{"id":"Abbi D.

We compared associations among accelerometer output, walking mobility, and physical activity between persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) and controls without a neurological disorder. Sixty-six persons (33 MS, 33 matched controls) completed a battery of questionnaires, performed the six-minute walk (6MW) and timed-up-and-go (TUG), and wore an accelerometer for a 7-day period. After this period, participants completed the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Accelerometer output was significantly correlated with only mobility measures (6MW, ρ = .78; TUG, ρ = −.68) in MS, whereas it correlated with both mobility (6MW, ρ = .58; TUG, ρ = −.49) and physical activity (GLTEQ, ρ = .56; IPAQ, ρ = .53) measures in controls. Regression analysis indicated that only 6MW explained variance in accelerometer output in MS ( β = .65, R 2 = .43).

Objective The goal of the research was to assess the feasibility of remote active testing and passive monitoring using smartphones and smartwatch technology in people with multiple sclerosis with respect to adherence and satisfaction with the FLOODLIGHT test battery. Methods People with multiple sclerosis (aged 20 to 57 years; Expanded Disability Status Scale 0-5.5; n=76) and healthy controls (n=25) performed the FLOODLIGHT test battery, comprising active tests (daily, weekly, every two weeks, or on demand) and passive monitoring (sensor-based gait and mobility) for 24 weeks using a smartphone and smartwatch. The primary analysis assessed adherence (proportion of weeks with at least 3 days of completed testing and 4 hours per day passive monitoring) and questionnaire-based satisfaction. In-clinic assessments (clinical and magnetic resonance imaging) were performed. Results People with multiple sclerosis showed 70% (16.68/24 weeks) adherence to active tests and 79% (18.89/24 weeks) to passive monitoring; satisfaction score was on average 73.7 out of 100. Neither adherence nor satisfaction was associated with specific population characteristics. Test-battery assessments had an at least acceptable impact on daily activities in over 80% (61/72) of people with multiple sclerosis. Conclusions People with multiple sclerosis were engaged and satisfied with the FLOODLIGHT test battery. FLOODLIGHT sensor-based measures may enable continuous assessment of multiple sclerosis disease in clinical trials and real-world settings.

All the subjects were evaluated with the timed 25-foot walking test (T25FW) while wearing a commercially available accelerometer. PwMS also rated the impact of the disease on their walking abilities using the 12-item MS walking scale (MSWS-12).All parameters objectively measured, except stride length, were significantly modified in pwMS with higher EDSS, with respect to HC and lower disability participants. Moderate to high correlations (r =0.57-0.79) were observed between gait parameters and MSWS-12 for pwMS of higher EDSS. The correlation was found moderate for the intermediate EDSS category (r =0.42-0.62).Wearable accelerometers are a useful tool for assessing gait performance for pwMS in a clinical setting, especially in cases of mild to moderate disability.

We examined total movement counts and three novel methods of processing accelerometer data (i.e. standard deviation, approximate entropy and detrended fluctuation analysis) for quantifying real-life walking impairment in this population. A total of 70 individuals with a definite diagnosis of multiple sclerosis completed a battery of patient-rated measures of walking impairment and then wore an ActiGraph accelerometer for 7 days. The data were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance and bivariate correlation analysis. The results indicated that total daily movement counts and standard deviation of daily movement counts differed between groups of persons with mild, moderate, and severe self-reported disability status and who were independently ambulatory or ambulatory with assistance. Those two metrics for the accelerometer data further demonstrated strong correlations with patient-rated measures of walking impairment. By comparison, there were smaller and often non-significant differences in approximate entropy and detrended fluctuation analysis metrics for the accelerometer data as a function of disability and ambulatory status, and only moderate correlations with patient-rated measures of walking impairment. The results confirm that the metric of total daily movement counts correlates with level of disability, ambulatory status, and patient reports of walking impairment in persons with multiple sclerosis. We further demonstrate that variability, indexed by the standard deviation of daily movement counts, correlates with multiple sclerosis-related disability, ambulatory status, and self-reported walking impairment. Such results provide preliminary evidence that variability in accelerometer counts is not simply noise and may provide important information about multiple sclerosis-related walking impairment.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2009788843","numberInSourceReferences":4,"doi":"10.1207/S15324796ABM3202_13","title":"Correlates of physical activity among individuals with multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Robert W.

This cross-sectional study examined the nature of associations among physical activity, aerobic capacity, and walking performance in persons with MS and healthy controls.The sample included 31 persons with MS and 31 controls matched by age, sex, height, and weight. Participants completed the 6-minute walk (6MW), wore an ActiGraph model GT3X accelerometer for 7 days as an objective measure of physical activity (expressed as time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity [MVPA]), and completed an incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer as a measure of aerobic capacity (VO2peak).Hierarchical linear regression analyses indicated that MVPA and VO2peak partially explained group differences in 6MW performance (R = 0.782), although group remained a significant predictor of 6MW performance (β = 0.304; P < 0.001). Path analysis indicated that group had both statistically significant direct and indirect effects on 6MW performance, and the indirect effect operated through pathways involving MVPA and VO2peak.These results provide direct preliminary evidence that physiological deconditioning, perhaps occurring as a result of physical inactivity, may explain variability in walking impairment in persons with MS.

Self-report instruments are commonly used to measure activity patterns; alternatively, actigraphs can be placed on several parts of the body. The aims of this study were to evaluate the superiority and specificity of actigraph placement (wrist vs. ankle) in subjects with MS and healthy controls and explore the relationship between self-report and objective activity patterns. A total of 19 subjects with definite MS and 10 healthy volunteers wore actigraphs on the non-dominant wrist and ankle for three days while they kept a log to register performed activities every .5 h. Wrist and ankle actigraphs produced similar activity patterns during the most active hours (09:00-20:30 h) (ANOVA, timexlocation interaction: F=.901, df=23, p=.597) in individuals with MS and healthy controls (between subjects factor F=3.275, p=.083). Wrist placement of the actigraphs was better tolerated than ankle placement. Wrist actigraph data corresponded to a higher degree with self-reported activities of the upper limbs in the early afternoon, whereas ankle data seem to reflect better whole body movements in the later afternoon/early evening. Overall, actigraph data correlated moderately with self-reported activity (r=.57 for ankle and r=.59 for wrist). The regression model revealed that self-reported activities explained 44% of the variance in ankle and 50% of wrist data. Wrist and ankle actigraphs produce similar activity patterns in subjects with MS and in healthy controls; however, the placement of actigraphs on the wrist is better tolerated. Ankle actigraphs reflect general movement but underestimate upper body activity. Subjective registration of activity level partly matches with objective actigraph measurement. A combination of both objective and subjective activity registration is recommended to evaluate the physical activity pattern of subjects with MS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W1996254614","numberInSourceReferences":86,"doi":"10.1016/J.PMEDR.2015.03.007","title":"Mobility disability and the pattern of accelerometer-derived sedentary and physical activity behaviors in people with multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Victor E.

Wireless inertial sensors can accurately measure numerous walking and balance parameters but these measures require evaluation of reliability in PwMS. The current study determined the test-retest reliability of wireless inertial sensor measures obtained during an instrumented standing balance test and an instrumented Timed Up and Go test in PwMS.Fifteen PwMS and 15 healthy control subjects (HC) performed an instrumented standing balance and instrumented Timed Up and Go (TUG) test on two separate days. Ten instrumented standing balance measures and 18 instrumented TUG measures were computed from the wireless sensor data. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated to determine test-retest reliability of all instrumented standing balance and instrumented TUG measures. Correlations were evaluated between the instrumented standing balance and instrumented TUG measures and self-reported walking and balance performance, fall history, and clinical disability.For both groups, ICCs for instrumented standing balance measures were best for spatio-temporal measures, while frequency measures were less reliable. All instrumented TUG measures exhibited good to excellent (ICCs > 0.60) test-retest reliability in PwMS and in HC. There were no correlations between self-report walking and balance scores and instrumented TUG or instrumented standing balance metrics, but there were correlations between instrumented TUG and instrumented standing balance metrics and fall history and clinical disability status.Measures from the instrumented standing balance and instrumented TUG tests exhibit good to excellent reliability, demonstrating their potential as objective assessments for clinical trials. A subset of the most reliable measures is recommended for measuring walking and balance in clinical settings.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2062399897","numberInSourceReferences":25,"doi":"10.1016/J.APMR.2009.03.020","title":"Calibration of Accelerometer Output for Ambulatory Adults With Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Robert W.

Each participant received an Android HTC Sensation 4G smartphone containing a custom application suite of 19 tests capturing participant performance and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Over 1 year, participants were prompted daily to complete one assigned test.A total of 22 patients with MS and 17 cohabitants completed the entire study. Among patients with MS, low scores on PROs relating to mental and visual function were associated with dropout (p < 0.05). We illustrate several novel features of a smartphone platform. First, fluctuations in MS outcomes (e.g., fatigue) were assessed against an individual's ambient environment by linking responses to meteorological data. Second, both response accuracy and speed for the Ishihara color vision test were captured, highlighting the benefits of both active and passive data collection. Third, a new trait, a person-specific learning curve in neuropsychological testing, was identified using spline analysis. Finally, averaging repeated measures over the study yielded the most robust correlation matrix of the different outcome measures.We report the feasibility of, and barriers to, deploying a smartphone platform to gather useful passive and active performance data at high frequency in an unstructured manner in the field. A smartphone platform may therefore enable large-scale naturalistic studies of patients with MS or other neurologic diseases.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2030705485","numberInSourceReferences":15,"doi":"10.1016/J.JNS.2007.11.003","title":"Confirmation and extension of the validity of the Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12)","authors":[{"id":"Robert W.

Contemporary methods to assess the level of physical activity in PwMS are regular clinical observation. However, these methods either rely on high recall and accurate reporting from the patients (e.g. self-report questionnaires), or they are conducted during a particular clinical assessment with predefined activities. Therefore, the main aim of this pilot study was to develop an objective method to gather information about the real type and intensity of daily activities performed by PwMS in every-day living situations using an accelerometer. Furthermore, the accelerometer-derived measures are investigated regarding their potential for discriminating between different MS groups.MethodsEleven PwMS that were able to walk independently (EDSS ≤ 5) were divided into two groups: mild disability (EDSS 1–2.5; n = 6) and moderate disability (EDSS 3 –5; n = 5). Participants made use of an activity monitor device attached to their waist during their normal daily activities over 4 measurements. Activity parameters were assessed and compared for the time of each participant’s first measurement and follow-up measurement. Furthermore, differences between both subgroups, and the correlation of activity parameters with the clinical neurological variable (EDSS) were investigated.ResultsParticipants showed significant decline in step count (p = 0.008), maximum walking speed (p = 0.02) and physical activity intensity (p = 0.03) throughout the study period. Compared to the mild subgroup, moderate affected participant accumulated less number of steps (G1: 9214.33 ± 2439.11, G2: 5018.13 ± 2416.96; p < 0.005) and were slower (G1: 1.48 ± 0.19, G2: 1.12 ± 0.44; p = 0.03). Additionally, the EDSS correlated negatively with mean walking speed (r = - 0.71, p = 0.01) and steps count (r = - 0.54, p = 0.08).ConclusionsIn this study, we used a portable activity monitoring sensor to gather information about everyday physical activity in PwMS at home. We showed that objective measurements using simple 3D accelerometers can track daily physical activity fluctuation. Furthermore, they track disability changes better than clinical measures. Thus, they can help to develop activity based treatments for PwMS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2089653770","numberInSourceReferences":63,"doi":"10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0073247","title":"Clinical Importance of Steps Taken per Day among Persons with Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Robert W.

Objective This study examined the accuracy and precision of common smartphone applications and motion sensors for measuring steps taken by MS patients while walking on a treadmill. Methods Forty-five MS patients (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) = 1.0–5.0) underwent two 500-step walking trials at comfortable walking speed on a treadmill. Participants wore five motion sensors: the Digi-Walker SW-200 pedometer (Yamax), the UP2 and UP Move (Jawbone), and the Flex and One (Fitbit). The smartphone applications were Health (Apple), Health Mate (Withings), and Moves (ProtoGeo Oy). Results The Fitbit One had the best absolute (mean = 490.6 steps, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 485.6–495.5 steps) and relative accuracy (1.9% error), and absolute (SD = 16.4) and relative precision (coefficient of variation (CV) = 0.0), for the first 500-step walking trial; this was repeated with the second trial. Relative accuracy was correlated with slower walking speed for the first ( r s = −.53) and second ( r s = −.53) trials. Conclusion The results suggest that the waist-worn Fitbit One is the most precise and accurate sensor for measuring steps when walking on a treadmill, but future research is needed (testing the device across a broader range of disability, at different speeds, and in real-life walking conditions) before inclusion in clinical research and practice with MS patients.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2140679422","numberInSourceReferences":61,"doi":"10.2522/PTJ.20120479","title":"Longitudinal Change in Physical Activity and Its Correlates in Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Robert W.

Objective This study examined change in physical activity and its symptomatic, social-cognitive, and ambulatory or disability correlates over a 2.5-year period of time in people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Methods On 6 occasions, each separated by 6 months, people (N=269) with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis completed assessments of symptoms, self-efficacy, walking impairment, disability, and physical activity. The participants wore an accelerometer for 7 days. The change in study variables over 6 time points was examined with unconditional latent growth curve modeling. The association among changes in study variables over time was examined using conditional latent growth curve modeling, and the associations were expressed as standardized path coefficients (β). Results There were significant linear changes in self-reported and objectively measured physical activity, self-efficacy, walking impairment, and disability over the 2.5-year period; there were no changes in fatigue, depression, and pain. The changes in self-reported and objective physical activity were associated with change in self-efficacy (β=.49 and β=.61, respectively), after controlling for other variables and confounders. Limitations The primary limitations of the study were the generalizability of results among those with progressive multiple sclerosis and inclusion of a single variable from social-cognitive theory. Conclusions Researchers should consider designing interventions that target self-efficacy for the promotion and maintenance of physical activity in this population.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2921754847","numberInSourceReferences":156,"doi":"10.1001/JAMANETWORKOPEN.2019.0570","title":"Association of Continuous Assessment of Step Count by Remote Monitoring With Disability Progression Among Adults With Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Valerie J Block","orcid":null,"LN":"Block","FN":"Valerie J","affil":"University of California, San Francisco (US)","name":"Valerie J Block"},{"id":"Riley Bove","orcid":"0000-0002-2034-8800","LN":"Bove","FN":"Riley","affil":"University of California, San Francisco (US)","name":"Riley Bove"},{"id":"Chao Zhao","orcid":null,"LN":"Zhao","FN":"Chao","affil":"University of California, San Francisco (US)","name":"Chao Zhao"},{"id":"Priya Garcha","orcid":null,"LN":"Garcha","FN":"Priya","affil":"University of California, San Francisco (US)","name":"Priya Garcha"},{"id":"Jennifer A.

More sensitive and ecologically valid outcome measures are needed to advance MS research.To assess continuous step count activity remotely among individuals with MS for 1 year and determine how average daily step count is associated with other measures of MS disability.In a prospective longitudinal observational cohort study, 95 adults with relapsing or progressive MS who were able to walk more than 2 minutes with or without an assistive device were recruited between June 15, 2015, and August 8, 2016, and remotely monitored in their natural environment for 1 year. Patients were excluded if they had a clinical relapse within 30 days or comorbidity contributing to ambulatory impairment. Longitudinal analysis was performed from October 2017 to March 2018. Revised analysis was performed in December 2018.Activity monitoring of step count using a wrist-worn accelerometer.Average daily step count compared with in-clinic assessments and patient-reported outcomes.Of the 95 participants recruited (59 women and 36 men; mean [SD] age, 49.6 [13.6] years [range, 22.0-74.0 years]), 35 (37%) had progressive MS, and the median baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale score was 4.0 (range, 0-6.5). At 1 year, 79 participants completed follow-up (83% retention). There was a modest reduction in accelerometer use during the 1 year of the study. A decreasing average daily step count during the study was associated with worsening of clinic-based outcomes (Timed 25-Foot Walk, β = -13.09; P < .001; Timed-Up-and-Go, β = -9.25; P < .001) and patient-reported outcomes (12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale, β = -17.96; P < .001). A decreasing average daily step count occurred even when the Expanded Disability Status Scale score remained stable, and 12 of 25 participants (48%) with a significant decrease in average daily step count during the study did not have a reduction on other standard clinic-based metrics. Participants with a baseline average daily step count below 4766 (cohort median) had higher odds of clinically meaningful disability (Expanded Disability Status Scale score) worsening at 1 year, adjusting for age, sex, and disease duration (odds ratio, 4.01; 95% CI, 1.17-13.78; P = .03).Continuous remote activity monitoring of individuals with MS for 1 year appears to be feasible. In this study, a decreasing average daily step count during a 1-year period was associated with worsening of standard ambulatory measures but could also occur even when traditional disability measures remained stable. These results appear to support the prospect of using the average daily step count as a sensitive longitudinal outcome measure in MS and as a clinically relevant metric for targeted intervention.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W1993618946","numberInSourceReferences":100,"doi":"10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0123822","title":"Ecological Validity of Walking Capacity Tests in Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Jan-Patrick Stellmann","orcid":null,"LN":"Stellmann","FN":"Jan-Patrick","affil":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (DE)","name":"Jan-Patrick Stellmann"},{"id":"A.

Further, we investigated how these discriminative measures relate to the disease severity of MS or PD. We recruited 13 people with MS, 21 MS-Ctl, 29 people with idiopathic PD, and 20 PD-Ctl. Subjects wore 3 inertial sensors on their feet and the lumbar back for a week. The Area Under Curves (AUC) from the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) plot was calculated for each measure to determine the objective measures that best separated the MS and PD groups from their respective control cohorts. Adherence wearing the sensors was similar among groups for 58–66 h of recording (p = 0.14). Quantity of mobility (activity measures, such as a median number of strides per gait bout, AUC = 0.93) best discriminated mobility impairments in MS from MS-Ctl. In contrast, quality of mobility (such as turn angle, AUC = 0.90) best discriminated mobility impairments in PD from PD-Ctl. Mobility measures with AUC > 0.80 were correlated with MS and PD clinical scores of disease severity. Thus, measures characterizing mobility impairments differ for MS versus PD during daily life suggesting that mobility measures for clinical trials and clinical practice need to be specific to each neurological disorder.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2124728280","numberInSourceReferences":13,"doi":"10.1177/0269215507082740","title":"An exploratory study of two measures of free-living physical activity for people with multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Laura Klassen","orcid":null,"LN":"Klassen","FN":"Laura","affil":"University of Saskatchewan (CA)","name":"Laura Klassen"},{"id":"Candice L Schachter","orcid":null,"LN":"Schachter","FN":"Candice L","affil":"University of Saskatchewan (CA)","name":"Candice L Schachter"},{"id":"Rhonda J.

Design: Exploratory, descriptive study. Subjects: Thirty individuals with multiple sclerosis and nine controls. Protocol: Individuals with multiple sclerosis were recruited to inactive, moderately active and active groups as defined by Adjusted Activity Scores from the Human Activity Profile. Control participants were recruited to an active group. Free-living physical activity was recorded over four consecutive days. Main measures: A TriTrac RT3 accelerometer and a self-report physical activity diary were used to measure activity. Results: Thirty-six participants completed data collection. For the participants with multiple sclerosis, both the accelerometer (P = 0.004) and the diary (P = 0.006) detected significant differences between inactive and active groups. The accelerometer also detected a significant difference between moderately active and active groups (P = 0.04). In contrast, the diary detected a significant difference between inactive and moderately active groups (P = 0.05). Accelerometer and diary scores were significantly correlated (r = 0.59). Accelerometer scores were significantly correlated with neurological status (r s = -0.64). Conclusions: Both measures readily differentiated least active from most active groups. The accelerometer also differentiated moderately active from active groups, suggesting suitability for use in detecting change in more active client groups, while the diary differentiated inactive from moderately active groups, suggesting suitability for use in detecting change in less active groups.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2069877274","numberInSourceReferences":29,"doi":"10.1097/NMD.0B013E3181D14131","title":"Symptoms and Physical Activity Among Adults With Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Robert W.

The primary model (chi square = 13.89, df = 10, p = 0.18, SRMR = 0.03, comparative fit index = 0.99) demonstrated that the path between overall symptoms and physical activity was indirect by way of fatigue (indirect path coefficient = -0.15) and depression (indirect path coefficient = -0.10). Such findings provide support for an indirect association between overall symptoms and physical activity by way of fatigue and depression in RRMS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W1966335503","numberInSourceReferences":18,"doi":"10.1016/J.APMR.2008.10.012","title":"Exploring Actical Accelerometers as an Objective Measure of Physical Activity in People With Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Nicola M.

During routine clinical visits, 57 people with secondary progressive MS and 24 healthy controls walked for 6 minutes wearing three inertial motion sensors. Fifteen gait measures were computed from the sensor data and tested for between-session reliability, for differences between controls and people with moderate and severe MS disability, and for correlation with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores. The majority of gait measures showed good to excellent between-session reliability when assessed in a subgroup of 23 healthy controls and 25 people with MS. These measures showed that people with MS walked with significantly longer step and stride durations, reduced step and stride regularity, and experienced difficulties in controlling and maintaining a stable walk when compared to controls. These abnormalities significantly increased in people with a higher level of disability and correlated with their EDSS scores. Reliable and objective gait-based biomarkers using wearable sensors have been identified. These biomarkers may allow clinicians to quantify clinically relevant alterations in gait in people with progressive MS within the context of regular clinical visits.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2051568088","numberInSourceReferences":30,"doi":"10.1016/J.MEDENGPHY.2010.08.015","title":"Does a waist-worn accelerometer capture intra- and inter-person variation in walking behavior among persons with multiple sclerosis?","authors":[{"id":"Robert W.

This study tested the assumption that a waist-worn accelerometer should capture the intra- and inter-person variation in walking behavior. Twenty-four participants with a neurologist-confirmed diagnosis of MS and who were ambulatory with minimal assistance undertook three 6-min periods of over-ground walking that involved comfortable (CWS) and then slower (SWS) and faster (FWS) walking speeds while wearing ActiGraph, model 7164, accelerometers around the waist and ankle. The experimental manipulation of walking was successful such that the CWS was 76.7 ± 13.0 m/min (range = 55.6–105.14), whereas the SWS and FWS were 64.3 ± 12.3 m/min (range = 44.5–90.1) and 89.1 ± 13.8 m/min (range = 60.9–116.4), respectively. Movement counts from the waist and ankle-worn accelerometer were strongly associated with the manipulation of speed, but the association was stronger for the waist than ankle based on both eta-squared estimates (η2 values = .78 and .46) and the average squared multiple correlations from individual regression analyses (R2 values = .97 ± .04 and .88 ± .21). The bivariate correlation between movement counts from the waist-worn accelerometer and speed of walking (r = .823, p = .001) was large in magnitude and significantly different (z = 3.22, p = .001) from that between movement counts from the ankle-worn unit and walking speed (r = .549, p = .001).

Instrumented measurement of standing postural sway with inertial motion sensors may provide sensitive measures of balance impairment and better correspond with patient reports.While wearing wireless inertial sensors, 20 subjects with MS - Expanded Disability Status Scale of less than 3.0 and a Timed 25 Foot Walk of 5 sec or less - and 20 age- and sex-matched control subjects stood with eyes open and eyes closed on a foam surface. Forty-six outcome measures of postural sway were derived. A stepwise logistic regression model determined which measures of instrumented sway provide independent predictors of group status. Subjects with MS also completed the Activities-Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale and the 12-Item MS Walking Scale (MSWS-12) as measures of subject-reported balance and mobility impairment.The regression model identified medio-lateral sway path length and medio-lateral range of sway acceleration amplitude, each in the eyes-open condition, as the only two significant independent predictors to differentiate subjects with MS from those without MS (model chi-squared = 34.55, p < 0.0001): accuracy = 87.5 %, positive likelihood ratio = 6 (2.09-17.21), negative likelihood ratio = 0.12 (0.03-0.44). Range of sway acceleration amplitude significantly correlated with both ABC (Spearman's r = -0.567, p = 0.009) and MSWS-12 scores (Spearman's r = -0.590, p = 0.006).Postural sway abnormalities in subjects with MS who are minimally disabled were detected using wireless inertial sensors and may signify a superior sensitivity to identify balance impairment prior to developing clinically evident disability or impaired gait speed. Further study is needed to confirm the clinical significance and predictive value of these objectively identified balance impairments.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2082956218","numberInSourceReferences":12,"doi":"10.1016/J.APMR.2008.02.027","title":"Measuring Free-Living Physical Activity in Adults With and Without Neurologic Dysfunction With a Triaxial Accelerometer","authors":[{"id":"Leigh Hale","orcid":null,"LN":"Hale","FN":"Leigh","affil":"University of Otago (NZ), Physiotherapy New Zealand (NZ)","name":"Leigh Hale"},{"id":"Jaya Pal","orcid":null,"LN":"Pal","FN":"Jaya","affil":"University of Otago (NZ), Physiotherapy New Zealand (NZ)","name":"Jaya Pal"},{"id":"Ines Becker","orcid":null,"LN":"Becker","FN":"Ines","affil":"University of Otago (NZ), Physiotherapy New Zealand (NZ)","name":"Ines Becker"}],"year":2008,"journal":"Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation","references":["W1824808911","W1966659385","W1982434105","W1982692230","W2001323070","W2008560062","W2009836285","W2013753927","W2014725775","W2015795623","W2033727719","W2043138815","W2045304791","W2048222657","W2053352781","W2054131260","W2058149090","W2079481888","W2084151313","W2086027855","W2114808411","W2122517711","W2130355701","W2138207766","W2169482678"],"citationsCount":103,"abstract":"To investigate the reliability, validity, and utility of a triaxial accelerometer to measure physical activity in the free-living environment in adults with and without neurologic dysfunction.Repeated-measures design.General community.Volunteer sample of 17 men and 30 women (age range, 28-91y) living in the community with stroke of greater than 6 months in duration (n=20), Parkinson disease (n=7), or multiple sclerosis (n=11), and healthy but sedentary controls (n=9).Not applicable.Physical activity measured with the TriTrac RT3 accelerometer, 7-day recall questionnaire, and activity diary.The accelerometer reliably measured free-living physical activity (intraclass correlation coefficient, .85; 95% confidence interval, .74-.91; P=.000).

We describe the Draw a Shape (DaS) Test, a smartphone-based and remotely administered test of Upper Extremity (UE) function developed for people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). This work introduces DaS-related features that characterise UE function and impairment, and aims to demonstrate how multivariate modelling of these metrics can reliably predict the 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT), a clinician-administered UE assessment in PwMS. Approach : The DaS Test instructed PwMS and healthy controls (HC) to trace predefined shapes on a smartphone screen. A total of 93 subjects (HC, n = 22; PwMS, n = 71) contributed both dominant and non-dominant handed DaS tests. PwMS subjects were characterised as those with normal (nPwMS, n = 50) and abnormal UE function (aPwMS, n = 21) with respect to their average 9HPT time (≤ or &gt; 22.7 (s), respectively). L 1 -regularization techniques, combined with linear least squares (OLS, IRLS), or non-linear support vector (SVR) or random forest (RFR) regression were investigated as functions to map relevant DaS features to 9HPT times. Main results : It was observed that average non-dominant handed 9HPT times were more accurately predicted by DaS features ( r 2 = 0.41, <?CDATA $P\\lt$?> <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mml:mi>P</mml:mi> <mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo> </mml:math> 0.05; MAE: 2.08 ± 0.34 (s)) than average dominant handed 9HPTs ( r 2 = 0.39, <?CDATA $P\\lt$?> <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mml:mi>P</mml:mi> <mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo> </mml:math> 0.05; MAE: 2.32 ± 0.43 (s)), using simple linear IRLS ( <?CDATA $P\\lt$?> <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mml:mi>P</mml:mi> <mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo> </mml:math> 0.01). Moreover, it was found that the Mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted 9HPTs was comparable to the variability of actual 9HPT times within HC, nPwMS and aPwMS groups respectively. The 9HPT however exhibited large heteroscedasticity resulting in less stable predictions of longer 9HPT times. Significance : This study demonstrates the potential of the smartphone-based DaS Test to reliably predict 9HPT times and remotely monitor UE function in PwMS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2037852491","numberInSourceReferences":68,"doi":"10.1016/J.APMR.2014.01.004","title":"Postural Response Latencies Are Related to Balance Control During Standing and Walking in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Jessie M.

However, direct evidence of 6MW induced gait deterioration is limited by the difficulty of measuring qualitative changes in walking.This study aims to (1) define and validate a measure of fatigue-related gait deterioration based on data from body-worn sensors; and (2) use this measure to detect gait deterioration induced by the 6MW.Gait deterioration was assessed using the Warp Score, a measure of similarity between gait cycles based on dynamic time warping (DTW). Cycles from later minutes were compared to baseline cycles in 89 subjects with MS and 29 controls. Correlation, corrected (partial) correlation, and linear regression were used to quantify relationships to walking and fatigue outcomes.Warp Scores rose between minute 3 and minute 6 in subjects with mild and moderate disability (p<0.001). Statistically significant correlations (p<0.001) to the MS walking scale (MSWS-12), modified fatigue impact scale (MFIS) physical subscale, and cerebellar and pyramidal functional system scores (FSS) were observed even after controlling for walking speed. Regression of MSWS-12 scores on Warp Scores and walking speed explained 73.9% of response variance. Correlations to individual MSWS-12 and MFIS items strongly suggest a relationship to fatigability.The Warp Score has been validated in MS subjects as an objective measure of fatigue-related gait deterioration. Progressive changes to gait cycles induced by the 6MW often appeared in later minutes, supporting the importance of sustained walking in clinical assessment.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2620639087","numberInSourceReferences":125,"doi":"10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0178366","title":"A machine learning approach for gait speed estimation using skin-mounted wearable sensors: From healthy controls to individuals with multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Ryan S.

However, assessment of gait speed in coordination with delivery of comprehensive care is usually constrained to clinical environments and is often limited due to mounting demands on the availability of trained clinical staff. These limitations in assessment design could give rise to poor ecological validity and limited ability to tailor interventions to individual patients. Recent advances in wearable sensor technologies have fostered the development of new methods for monitoring parameters that characterize mobility impairment, such as gait speed, outside the clinic, and therefore address many of the limitations associated with clinical assessments. However, these methods are often validated using normal gait patterns; and extending their utility to subjects with gait impairments continues to be a challenge. In this paper, we present a machine learning method for estimating gait speed using a configurable array of skin-mounted, conformal accelerometers. We establish the accuracy of this technique on treadmill walking data from subjects with normal gait patterns and subjects with multiple sclerosis-induced gait impairments. For subjects with normal gait, the best performing model systematically overestimates speed by only 0.01 m/s, detects changes in speed to within less than 1%, and achieves a root-mean-square-error of 0.12 m/s. Extending these models trained on normal gait to subjects with gait impairments yields only minor changes in model performance. For example, for subjects with gait impairments, the best performing model systematically overestimates speed by 0.01 m/s, quantifies changes in speed to within 1%, and achieves a root-mean-square-error of 0.14 m/s. Additional analyses demonstrate that there is no correlation between gait speed estimation error and impairment severity, and that the estimated speeds maintain the clinical significance of ground truth speed in this population. These results support the use of wearable accelerometer arrays for estimating walking speed in normal subjects and their extension to MS patient cohorts with gait impairment.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W1999839412","numberInSourceReferences":40,"doi":"10.1519/JPT.0B013E31820AA921","title":"Validity of the StepWatch Step Activity Monitor","authors":[{"id":"Amy E.

Self-report questionnaires rely on the participant's cognitive function and reporting accuracy, while the association between clinical timed walk tests and community ambulation may not be strong. Progress toward the identification of an appropriate clinical tool to measure strides in PD and MS populations is hampered by the lack of meaningful research and reference standards in this area.The objective of the present study was to explore the validity of the StepWatch Step Activity Monitor (SAM) in assessing stride count in persons with PD or MS. The SAM is a 2-dimensional accelerometer that counts strides and is calibrated for individual participants.A convenience sample of 20 participants completed a health history interview. Participants ambulated approximately 15 m while wearing the SAM to establish appropriate baseline calibrations, matching their stride with the device settings. Next, participants took 3 passes over the GaitMat II (GM II) while wearing the SAM. Strides counted by the GM were compared with the strides counted by the SAM.The Pearson correlation coefficients (r) for MS and PD, respectively, were 0.99 and 1.0.Our investigation presents preliminary data that shows the concurrent validity of the SAM when compared with the gold standard GM. The SAM appears to be a valid tool for use in persons with PD and MS.

This study explores the feasibility of assessing PwMS and Healthy Control's (HC) physical function by characterising gait-related features, which can be modelled using machine learning (ML) techniques to correctly distinguish subgroups of PwMS from healthy controls. A total of 97 subjects (24 HC subjects, 52 mildly disabled (PwMSmild, EDSS [0–3]) and 21 moderately disabled (PwMSmod, EDSS [3.5–5.5]) contributed data which was recorded from a Two-Minute Walk Test (2MWT) performed out-of-clinic and daily over a 24-week period. Signal-based features relating to movement were extracted from sensors in smartphone and smartwatch devices. A large number of features ( n = 156) showed fair-to-strong (R  $>$  0.3) correlations with clinical outcomes. LASSO feature selection was applied to select and rank subsets of features used for dichotomous classification between subject groups, which were compared using Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) models. Classifications of subject types were compared using data obtained from smartphone, smartwatch and the fusion of features from both devices. Models built on smartphone features alone achieved the highest classification performance, indicating that accurate and remote measurement of the ambulatory characteristics of HC and PwMS can be achieved with only one device. It was observed however that smartphone-based performance was affected by inconsistent placement location (running belt versus pocket). Results show that PwMSmod could be distinguished from HC subjects (Acc. 82.2  $\\pm$  2.9%, Sen. 80.1  $\\pm$  3.9%, Spec. 87.2  $\\pm$  4.2%, F $_{1}$  84.3  $\\pm$  3.8), and PwMSmild (Acc. 82.3  $\\pm$  1.9%, Sen. 71.6  $\\pm$  4.2%, Spec. 87.0  $\\pm$  3.2%, F ${1}$  75.1  $\\pm$  2.2) using an SVM classifier with a Radial Basis Function (RBF). PwMSmild were shown to exhibit HC-like behaviour and were thus less distinguishable from HC (Acc. 66.4  $\\pm$  4.5%, Sen. 67.5  $\\pm$  5.7%, Spec. 60.3  $\\pm$  6.7%, F $_{1}$  58.6  $\\pm$  5.8).

This study involved a secondary data analysis for providing reliability estimates for measures of physical activity over a six-month period in MS. On two occasions separated by six months, participants completed the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) and wore an ActiGraph model 7164 accelerometer on a belt around the waist for a seven-day period. The outcomes from the accelerometer were total activity counts and minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day.

The ICCs for GLTEQ scores, total activity counts, and minutes of MVPA were .66, .84, and .84, respectively. Additionally, the sample was less physically active than adults without MS, and correlation analyses supported the validity of the measures, but within a substantially larger sample. Overall, the measures had acceptable, but different, reliability over six months in this sample of mostly women with relapsing-remitting MS.

As a step towards better understanding gait during daily life in neurological populations, we compared gait measures that best discriminated people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and people with Parkinson’s Disease (PD) from their respective, age-matched, healthy control subjects (MS-Ctl, PD-Ctl) in laboratory tests versus a week of daily life monitoring. Methods We recruited 15 people with MS (age mean ± SD: 49 ± 10 years), 16 MS-Ctl (45 ± 11 years), 16 people with idiopathic PD (71 ± 5 years), and 15 PD-Ctl (69 ± 7 years). Subjects wore 3 inertial sensors (one each foot and lower back) in the laboratory followed by 7 days during daily life. Mann–Whitney U test and area under the curve (AUC) compared differences between PD and PD-Ctl, and between MS and MS-Ctl in the laboratory and in daily life. Results Participants wore sensors for 60–68 h in daily life. Measures that best discriminated gait characteristics in people with MS and PD from their respective control groups were different between the laboratory gait test and a week of daily life. Specifically, the toe-off angle best discriminated MS versus MS-Ctl in the laboratory (AUC [95% CI] = 0.80 [0.63–0.96]) whereas gait speed in daily life (AUC = 0.84 [0.69–1.00]). In contrast, the lumbar coronal range of motion best discriminated PD versus PD-Ctl in the laboratory (AUC = 0.78 [0.59–0.96]) whereas foot-strike angle in daily life (AUC = 0.84 [0.70–0.98]). AUCs were larger in daily life compared to the laboratory. Conclusions Larger AUC for daily life gait measures compared to the laboratory gait measures suggest that daily life monitoring may be more sensitive to impairments from neurological disease, but each neurological disease may require different gait outcome measures.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3010654752","numberInSourceReferences":206,"doi":"10.1007/S00415-020-09759-7","title":"A wearable sensor identifies alterations in community ambulation in multiple sclerosis: contributors to real-world gait quality and physical activity","authors":[{"id":"S.

These changes in gait have been well studied in laboratory and clinical settings. A thorough investigation of gait alterations during community ambulation and their contributing factors, however, is lacking. The aim of the present study was to evaluate community ambulation and physical activity in pwMS and healthy controls and to compare in-lab gait to community ambulation. To this end, 104 subjects were studied: 44 pwMS and 60 healthy controls (whose age was similar to the controls). The subjects wore a tri-axial, lower back accelerometer during usual-walking and dual-task walking in the lab and during community ambulation (1 week) to evaluate the amount, type, and quality of activity. The results showed that during community ambulation, pwMS took fewer steps and walked more slowly, with greater asymmetry, and larger stride-to-stride variability, compared to the healthy controls (p < 0.001). Gait speed during most of community ambulation was significantly lower than the in-lab usual-walking value and similar to the in-lab dual-tasking value. Significant group (pwMS /controls)-by-walking condition (in-lab/community ambulation) interactions were observed (e.g., gait speed). Greater disability was associated with fewer steps and reduced gait speed during community ambulation. In contrast, physical fatigue was correlated with sedentary activity, but was not related to any of the measures of community ambulation gait quality including gait speed. This disparity suggests that more than one mechanism contributes to community ambulation and physical activity in pwMS. Together, these findings demonstrate that during community ambulation, pwMS have marked gait alterations in multiple gait features, reminiscent of dual-task walking measured in the laboratory. Disease-related factors associated with these changes might be targets of rehabilitation.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2996276198","numberInSourceReferences":162,"doi":"10.1038/S41746-019-0197-7","title":"Quantifying neurologic disease using biosensor measurements in-clinic and in free-living settings in multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Tanuja Chitnis","orcid":null,"LN":"Chitnis","FN":"Tanuja","affil":"Brigham and Women's Hospital (US), Harvard University (US)","name":"Tanuja Chitnis"},{"id":"Bonnie I.

Here, we studied multiple sclerosis (MS) as a model neurological disease for investigating physiometric and environmental signals. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility and correlation of wearable biosensors with traditional clinical measures of disability both in clinic and in free-living in MS patients. This is a single site observational cohort study conducted at an academic neurological center specializing in MS. A cohort of 25 MS patients with varying disability scores were recruited. Patients were monitored in clinic while wearing biosensors at nine body locations at three separate visits. Biosensor-derived features including aspects of gait (stance time, turn angle, mean turn velocity) and balance were collected, along with standardized disability scores assessed by a neurologist. Participants also wore up to three sensors on the wrist, ankle, and sternum for 8 weeks as they went about their daily lives. The primary outcomes were feasibility, adherence, as well as correlation of biosensor-derived metrics with traditional neurologist-assessed clinical measures of disability. We used machine-learning algorithms to extract multiple features of motion and dexterity and correlated these measures with more traditional measures of neurological disability, including the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and the MS functional composite-4 (MSFC-4). In free-living, sleep measures were additionally collected. Twenty-three subjects completed the first two of three in-clinic study visits and the 8-week free-living biosensor period. Several biosensor-derived features significantly correlated with EDSS and MSFC-4 scores derived at visit two, including mobility stance time with MSFC-4 z-score (Spearman correlation −0.546; p = 0.0070), several aspects of turning including turn angle (0.437; p = 0.0372), and maximum angular velocity (0.653; p = 0.0007). Similar correlations were observed at subsequent clinic visits, and in the free-living setting. We also found other passively collected signals, including measures of sleep, that correlated with disease severity. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of applying passive biosensor measurement techniques to monitor disability in MS patients both in clinic and in the free-living setting.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2063918502","numberInSourceReferences":45,"doi":"10.1249/MSS.0B013E31822D7997","title":"Vascular Dysfunction and Physical Activity in Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Sushant M.

Disability status and progression are associated with reduced physical activity (PA) and cardiovascular function. Lack of adequate PA combined with inflammation may create high susceptibility to subclinical atherosclerosis and vascular dysfunction. Purpose The purpose of this study was to compare subclinical atherosclerosis and arterial function between individuals with and without MS matched for age, sex, and body mass index. Methods Thirty-three individuals diagnosed with MS and 33 controls underwent strain gauge plethysmography for resting forearm blood flow (FBF) and peak reactive hyperemia for the microvascular function. Intima–media thickness and arterial compliance (AC) were measured using carotid ultrasound for vascular function. C-reactive protein and PA (7-d accelerometer data) were also measured. Results There was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in resting FBF, peak reactive hyperemia, central pulse wave velocity, and AC between the MS and control groups. PA was associated with peak FBF and central pulse wave velocity but not FBF and carotid AC. Individuals with MS exhibit reduced arterial function but similar intima-media thickness compared with controls. Persons with MS had significantly reduced PA levels compared with controls, and PA accounted for differences in arterial function between groups. Conclusions These results indicate that subclinical markers of atherosclerosis are higher in individuals with MS, suggesting a higher risk of cardiovascular disease in this population. However, the higher levels of subclinical atherosclerosis were accounted for by the low PA in persons with MS, suggesting that increasing PA may reduce the increase in cardiovascular disease risk in patients with MS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2998382978","numberInSourceReferences":164,"doi":"10.1016/J.MSARD.2019.101903","title":"Objective sensor-based gait measures reflect motor impairment in multiple sclerosis patients: Reliability and clinical validation of a wearable sensor device","authors":[{"id":"Felix Flachenecker","orcid":null,"LN":"Flachenecker","FN":"Felix","affil":"University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (DE)","name":"Felix Flachenecker"},{"id":"Klaus Pfeifer","orcid":null,"LN":"Pfeifer","FN":"Klaus","affil":"University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (DE)","name":"Klaus Pfeifer"},{"id":"Julius Hannik","orcid":null,"LN":"Hannik","FN":"Julius","affil":"Portabiles HealthCare Technologies GmbH, Erlangen 91054, Germany.","name":"Julius Hannik"},{"id":"De-Hyung Lee","orcid":null,"LN":"Lee","FN":"De-Hyung","affil":"University of Regensburg (DE)","name":"De-Hyung Lee"},{"id":"Peter Flachenecker","orcid":null,"LN":"Flachenecker","FN":"Peter","affil":"Neurologisches Rehabilitationszentrum Quellenhof Bad Wildbad (DE)","name":"Peter Flachenecker"},{"id":"Jürgen Winkler","orcid":null,"LN":"Winkler","FN":"Jürgen","affil":"University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (DE)","name":"Jürgen Winkler"},{"id":"Bjoern M.

The Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12) was used as a subjective measure of patient mobility. Patients were divided into EDSS and functional system subgroups.Datasets between two consecutive measurements (test-retest-reliability) were highly correlated in all analysed mean gait parameters (e.g. 25FWT_fast: stride length r = 0.955, gait speed r = 0.969) Subgroup analysis between HC and PwMS with lower (EDSS≤3.5) and higher (EDSS 4.0-7.0) disability showed significant differences in mean stride length, gait speed, toe off angle, stance time and swing time (e.g. stride length of EDSS subgroups 25FWT_fast p ≤ 0.001, 25FWT_pref p = 0.003). The differences between EDSS subgroups were more pronounced in fast than in self-selected gait speed (e.g. stride length 25FWT_fast 33.6 cm vs. 25FWT_pref 16.3 cm). Stride length (25FWT_fast) highly correlated to EDSS (r=-0.583) and MSWS-12 (r=-0.668). We observed significant differences between HC and PwMS with (FS 0-1) and without (FS≥2) pyramidal or cerebellar disability (e.g. gait speed of FS subgroups p ≤ 0.001).Sensor-based gait analysis objectively supports the clinical assessment of gait abnormalities even in the lower stages of MS, especially when walking with fast speed. Stride length and gait speed where identified as the most clinically relevant gait measures. Thus, it may be used to support the assessment of PwMS with gait impairment in the future, e.g. for more objective classification of disability. Its role in home-monitoring scenarios need to be evaluated in further studies.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2006779083","numberInSourceReferences":21,"doi":"10.1016/J.JPAINSYMMAN.2008.08.004","title":"Symptom Cluster as a Predictor of Physical Activity in Multiple Sclerosis: Preliminary Evidence","authors":[{"id":"Robert W.

Mean age of participants was 54 years (range 27-76).Physical Activity and Disability Survey (PADS) and Actical accelerometer.A wide range of standardized PADS scores were recorded at each time-point (ranges 6.7-83.3 and 6.7-87.4). While standardized PADS scores between time-points had a high intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.92 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88, 0.98), Bland-Altman 95% limits of agreement (-17.4, 17.4) were modest. Accelerometer activity counts were not accurately predicted by standardized PADS scores (wide 95% prediction intervals). Participants reported the PADS was easy to understand and complete, enabling them to give an accurate picture of their physical activity.The PADS appears to be a potentially appropriate measure of activity for people with multiple sclerosis, particularly in terms of the wide range of activities it covers and its ability to detect varying levels of physical activity.

Nonetheless, it is not clear how IMU-based metrics might be influenced by pragmatic aspects associated with clinical translation of this approach, such as data collection settings and gait protocols. In this study, we hypothesised that these aspects do not significantly alter those characteristics of gait that are more related to quality and energetic efficiency and are quantifiable via acceleration related metrics, such as intensity, smoothness, stability, symmetry, and regularity. To test this hypothesis, we compared 33 IMU-based metrics extracted from data, retrospectively collected by two independent centres on two matched cohorts of pwMS. As a worst-case scenario, a walking test was performed in the two centres at a different speed along corridors of different lengths, using different IMU systems, which were also positioned differently. The results showed that the majority of the temporal metrics (9 out of 12) exhibited significant between-centre differences. Conversely, the between-centre differences in the gait quality metrics were small and comparable to those associated with a test-retest analysis under equivalent conditions. Therefore, the gait quality metrics are promising candidates for reliable multi-centric studies aiming at assessing rehabilitation interventions within a routine clinical context.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2175013203","numberInSourceReferences":84,"doi":"10.7224/1537-2073.2014-037","title":"Use of Accelerometers to Measure Real-Life Physical Activity in Ambulatory Individuals with Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Cecilie Fjeldstad","orcid":null,"LN":"Fjeldstad","FN":"Cecilie","affil":"Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (US)","name":"Cecilie Fjeldstad"},{"id":"Anette S.

This study examined whether physical activity was differentially associated with walking performance across three age groups of young (20-39 years), middle-aged (40-59 years), and older (60-79 years) adults with MS.The sample included 124 persons with MS who attended one testing session and provided demographic information, completed the Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) and the Six Minute Walk (6MW) as measures of walking speed and walking endurance, respectively, and wore an accelerometer for a 7-day period.Trend analysis indicated light physical activity did not significantly differ with increasing age; however, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), walking speed, and walking endurance declined with increasing age. Partial spearman's rank-order correlations between physical activity and walking outcomes that controlled for disease duration, race, and ambulatory disability within each age group indicated that the relationship between MVPA and walking performance was strong among older adults with MS (prs for MVPA and T25FW: young = -0.01, middle-aged = -0.16, older = -0.63*; prs for MVPA and 6MW: young = 0.10, middle-aged = 0.08, older = 0.68*).Interventions targeting MVPA may be an appropriate approach for managing walking impairment, particularly in older adults with MS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2587391403","numberInSourceReferences":127,"doi":"10.1016/J.GAITPOST.2017.02.005","title":"Minimum number of days required for a reliable estimate of daily step count and energy expenditure, in people with MS who walk unaided","authors":[{"id":"Michelle Norris","orcid":"0000-0001-6109-2103","LN":"Norris","FN":"Michelle","affil":"University of Portsmouth (GB)","name":"Michelle Norris"},{"id":"Ross Anderson","orcid":null,"LN":"Anderson","FN":"Ross","affil":"University of Limerick (IE)","name":"Ross Anderson"},{"id":"Robert W.

Objectives: To develop an accurate method for remote assessment of walking speed and to test how predictive the clinic T25FW is for real-life walking. Methods: An AX3-Axivity tri-axial accelerometer was positioned on 32 MS patients (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] 0-6) in the clinic, who subsequently wore it at home for up to 7 days. Gait speed was calculated from these data using both a model developed with healthy volunteers and individually personalized models generated from a machine learning algorithm. Results: The healthy volunteer model predicted gait speed poorly for more disabled people with MS. However, the accuracy of individually personalized models was high regardless of disability (R-value = 0.98, p-value = 1.85 × 10-22). With the latter, we confirmed that the clinic T25FW is strongly predictive of the maximum sustained gait speed in the home environment (R-value = 0.89, p-value = 4.34 × 10-8). Conclusion: Remote gait monitoring with individually personalized models is accurate for patients with MS. Using these models, we have directly validated the clinical meaningfulness (i.e., predictiveness) of the clinic T25FW for the first time.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2774672244","numberInSourceReferences":158,"doi":"10.1519/JPT.0000000000000163","title":"Physical and Cognitive Functions, Physical Activity, and Sedentary Behavior in Older Adults With Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Rachel E.

This study compared physical and cognitive functions, sedentary behavior, and physical activity between 40 older adults with MS (ie, 60 years of age and older) and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy older adults. We further examined whether physical activity and/or sedentary behavior explained differences between groups in physical and cognitive functions.Participants initially underwent the cognitive assessments, followed by the physical function assessments. The order of tests was standardized and participants were provided seated-rest between the administrations of the physical function assessments. Participants were then instructed to wear an accelerometer and document wear time in a log book for a 7-day period after the testing session.Multivariate analyses of variance indicated that older adults with MS (n = 40) performed worse on all measures of physical function, and 1 measure of cognitive function (ie, information-processing speed), compared with healthy controls (n = 40). Older adults with MS engaged in less moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, more sedentary behavior, and longer duration of long sedentary bouts than healthy controls. Pearson correlations demonstrated that levels and patterns of physical activity were significantly associated with a majority of physical function variables but not cognitive function variables in both older adults with MS and healthy controls but to a greater extent in older adults with MS. Partial Pearson correlations further demonstrated that levels and patterns of sedentary behavior were significantly associated with a majority of physical function variables but not cognitive function variables primarily in older adults with MS. Linear regression analyses indicated that levels and patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior partially accounted for differences in physical and cognitive function variables between older adults with MS and healthy controls.There is evidence of reduced function in older adults with MS, and this might be partially managed by behavioral interventions that target physical activity and sedentary behavior for the promotion of healthy aging in older adults with MS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2625678039","numberInSourceReferences":136,"doi":"10.1123/JAPA.2016-0358","title":"Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Physical Function in Older Adults With Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Katie L.J.

Ambulatory persons (5 males/17 females; 13 without aid/9 with aid) with MS wore a triaxial accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3X, Health One Technologies; Fort Walton Beach, Florida) as well as an IDEEA system (MiniSun, Inc; Fresno, Florida) over the course of a single day.

Outcomes for the IDEEA system included percent time walking, sitting, and standing, as well as walking speed. Pearson product correlations (r) were used to examine the associations between outcomes from the accelerometer and IDEEA system. Significant correlations were observed between percent walking time and movement counts/hour along the vertical (r = 0.84) and anterior-posterior (r = 0.69) axes. Significant correlations were further noted between movement counts/hour along the vertical axis and walking speed (r = 0.45) and self-report walking impairment (r = -0.50) and disability (r = -0.46).

This task is usually assessed with clinical scales suffering from partial subjectivity and limited detail in evaluating different task aspects. In this paper, we instrumented the assessment of stair ascent in people with multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke (ST), and Parkinson's disease (PD) to analyze the validity of the proposed quantitative indexes and characterize subjects' performances. Participants climbed 10 steps wearing a magneto-inertial sensor [magneto-inertial measurement unit (MIMU)] at sternum level. Gait pattern features (step frequency, symmetry, regularity, and harmonic ratios), and upper trunk sway were computed from MIMU signals. Clinical modified dynamic gait index (mDGI) and mDGI-Item 8 \"Up stairs\" were administered. Significant correlations with clinical scores were found for gait pattern features ( ) and trunk pitch sway ( ) demonstrating their validity. Instrumental indexes showed alterations in the three pathological groups compared to healthy subjects and significant differences, not clinically detected, among MS, ST, and PD. MS showed the worst performance, with alterations of all gait pattern aspects and larger trunk pitch sway. ST showed worsening in gait pattern features but not in trunk motion. PD showed fewer alterations consisting in reduced step frequency and trunk yaw sway. These results suggest that the use of an MIMU provided valid objective indexes revealing between-group differences in stair ascent not detected by clinical scales. Importantly, the indexes include upper trunk measures, usually not present in clinical tests, and provide relevant hints for tailored rehabilitation.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2607430753","numberInSourceReferences":129,"doi":"10.1016/J.MSARD.2017.04.002","title":"Are static and functional balance abilities related in individuals with Multiple Sclerosis?","authors":[{"id":"Massimiliano Pau","orcid":"0000-0001-9835-3629","LN":"Pau","FN":"Massimiliano","affil":"University of Cagliari (IT)","name":"Massimiliano Pau"},{"id":"Micaela Porta","orcid":"0000-0003-3835-6507","LN":"Porta","FN":"Micaela","affil":"University of Cagliari (IT)","name":"Micaela Porta"},{"id":"Giancarlo Coghe","orcid":null,"LN":"Coghe","FN":"Giancarlo","affil":"University of Cagliari (IT)","name":"Giancarlo Coghe"},{"id":"Federica Corona","orcid":"0000-0002-4928-5129","LN":"Corona","FN":"Federica","affil":"University of Cagliari (IT)","name":"Federica Corona"},{"id":"Giuseppina Pilloni","orcid":"0000-0001-6226-5627","LN":"Pilloni","FN":"Giuseppina","affil":"University of Cagliari (IT)","name":"Giuseppina Pilloni"},{"id":"Lorena Lorefice","orcid":null,"LN":"Lorefice","FN":"Lorena","affil":"University of Cagliari (IT)","name":"Lorena Lorefice"},{"id":"Maria Giovanna Marrosu","orcid":null,"LN":"Marrosu","FN":"Maria Giovanna","affil":"University of Cagliari (IT)","name":"Maria Giovanna Marrosu"},{"id":"Eleonora Cocco","orcid":null,"LN":"Cocco","FN":"Eleonora","affil":"University of Cagliari (IT)","name":"Eleonora Cocco"}],"year":2017,"journal":"Multiple sclerosis and related disorders","references":["W1814706065","W1892283348","W1965860009","W1974704788","W2001818617","W2005877913","W2026051200","W2039043944","W2042491206","W2049804141","W2054993788","W2068583168","W2069988082","W2097303544","W2104640464","W2106217268","W2107625176","W2108302461","W2114303011","W2122190417","W2122545833","W2125948867","W2129082920","W2143939664","W2156691412","W2158051318","W2162961551","W2163778434","W2179844194","W2290390881","W2318456714","W2342769304","W2402357952","W2482468960","W2520137623","W2545862307","W2592749504","W2916040650"],"citationsCount":19,"abstract":"In people with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS), balance assessment is essential in estimating the risk of falls, monitoring disease progression and verifying the effectiveness of rehabilitative treatment. Clinical tools and instrumental techniques are available for testing static and dynamic balance, but the relationship between such abilities is still not clear. Having information about this link would be important in properly planning the type and number of tests to administer.One hundred and six pwMS (Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS 0-6.5) stratified in three sub-groups (Class 1 EDSS 0-1.5, Class 2 EDSS 2-4 and Class 3 EDSS 4.5-6.5) and 42 healthy controls (HC) participated in the study. All underwent static posturography and instrumented Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG) performed using a wearable inertial sensor. Raw data were processed to extract postural sway features, overall duration of TUG and its main sub-phases (i.e. sit-to-stand, 180° turns and stand-to-sit).All sway parameters of pwMS of Classes 2 and 3, as well as total TUG duration and time necessary to perform 180° turns, were found significantly higher than HC and Class 1 participants. However, poor correlations were found between sway and TUG parameters. When pwMS are grouped, small/moderate correlations (in the range 0.20-0.41) were found between all sway parameters and total TUG duration.Static and dynamic balance in pwMS appear scarcely correlated, although both worsen as disability increases. This implies that they should be separately assessed using specific tests to have a complete view of postural control performance in MS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2528301555","numberInSourceReferences":103,"doi":"10.1016/J.JPEDS.2016.08.104","title":"Physical Activity and Its Correlates in Youth with Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Stephanie A.

The Timed-Up-And-Go (TUG) task is used to assess patient mobility because it incorporates clinically-relevant submovements during standing. Most sensor-based TUG research has focused on the placement of sensors at the spine, hip or ankles; an examination of thigh activity in TUG in multiple sclerosis is wanting. Methods: We used validated sensors (x-IMU by x-io) to derive transparent metrics for the sit-to-stand (SI-ST) transition and the stand-to-sit (ST-SI) transition of TUG, and compared effect sizes for metrics from inertial sensors on the thighs to effect sizes for metrics from a sensor placed at the L3 level of the lumbar spine. Twenty-three healthy volunteers were compared to 17 ambulatory persons with MS (PwMS, HAI ≤ 2). Results: During the SI-ST transition, the metric with the largest effect size comparing healthy volunteers to PwMS was the Area Under the Curve of the thigh angular velocity in the pitch direction-representing both thigh and knee extension; the peak of the spine pitch angular velocity during SI-ST also had a large effect size, as did some temporal measures of duration of SI-ST, although less so. During the ST-SI transition the metric with the largest effect size in PwMS was the peak of the spine angular velocity curve in the roll direction. A regression was performed. Discussion: We propose for PwMS that the diminished peak angular velocity during SI-ST directly represents extensor weakness, while the increased roll during ST-SI represents diminished postural control. Conclusions: During the SI-ST transition of TUG, angular velocities can discriminate between healthy volunteers and ambulatory PwMS better than temporal features. Sensor placement on the thighs provides additional discrimination compared to sensor placement at the lumbar spine.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2202556201","numberInSourceReferences":93,"doi":"10.1155/2015/964790","title":"Stride-Time Variability and Fall Risk in Persons with Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Yaejin Moon","orcid":null,"LN":"Moon","FN":"Yaejin","affil":"University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (US)","name":"Yaejin Moon"},{"id":"Douglas A.

Discriminant function analysis indicated that SI-S scores better differentiated groups with minimal, moderate, and severe disability than did SI-L and PS scores. Regression analysis indicated that SI-S and SI-L scores explained incrementally more variance in EDSS, MSWS-12, and MSIS-29 scores after accounting for PS scores alone.Such findings provide additional support for the validity of both SI-S and SI-L scores in individuals with MS and support the adoption of either the SI-S or SI-L by clinical MS researchers.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3097413421","numberInSourceReferences":191,"doi":"10.1177/1352458520968797","title":"Real-world keystroke dynamics are a potentially valid biomarker for clinical disability in multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"K.Y.

Keyboard interactions were obtained with the Neurokeys keyboard app. Eight timing-related keystroke features were assessed for reliability with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs); construct validity by analysing group differences (in fatigue, gadolinium-enhancing lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and patients vs controls); and concurrent validity by correlating with disability measures.Reliability was moderate in two (ICC = 0.601 and 0.742) and good to excellent in the remaining six features (ICC = 0.760-0.965). Patients had significantly higher keystroke latencies than controls. Latency between key presses correlated the highest with Expanded Disability Status Scale (r = 0.407) and latency between key releases with Nine-Hole Peg Test and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (ρ = 0.503 and r = -0.553, respectively), ps < 0.001.Keystroke dynamics were reliable, distinguished patients and controls, and were associated with clinical disability measures.

MSCopilot is a software medical device for the self-assessment of patients with MS (PwMS), combining four tests: walking, dexterity, cognition and low contrast vision. The objective was to validate MSCopilot versus the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC). METHODS This multicentre, open-label, randomized, controlled, crossover study enrolled 141 PwMS and 76 healthy controls (HCs). All participants performed MSCopilot and MSFC tests at day 0. To assess reproducibility, 46 PwMS performed the same tests at day 30 ± 3. The primary end-point was the validation of MSCopilot versus MSFC for the identification of PwMS against HCs, quantified using the area under the curve (AUC). The main secondary end-point was the correlation of MSCopilot z-scores with MSFC z-scores. RESULTS In all, 116 PwMS and 69 HCs were analysed. The primary end-point was achieved: MSCopilot performance was non-inferior to that of MSFC (AUC 0.92 and 0.89 respectively; P = 0.3). MSCopilot and MSFC discriminated PwMS and HCs with 81% and 76% sensitivity and 82% and 88% specificity respectively. Digital and standard test scores were highly correlated (r = 0.81; P < 0.001). The test-retest study demonstrated the good reproducibility of MSCopilot. CONCLUSION This study confirms the reliability of MSCopilot and its usability in clinical practice for the monitoring of MS-related disability.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2339625437","numberInSourceReferences":106,"doi":"10.1123/APAQ.2015-0007","title":"Reliability of Accelerometer Scores for Measuring Sedentary and Physical Activity Behaviors in Persons With Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Rachel E.

Women with MS spent more time in sedentary behavior and exhibited a reduced amount of light intensity activity with respect to men, while MVPA was similar across sexes. However, in comparison with unaffected individuals, the overall PA patterns appear significantly modified mostly in women who, in presence of the disease, present increased sedentary behavior, reduced MVPA, number of daily steps and VM counts.

Fatigue is a debilitating symptom in multiple sclerosis (MS) that may be associated with reduced physical activity and increased sedentary behavior. Objective. This study examined the associations among fatigue and device-measured physical activity and sedentary behavior in people with MS. Methods. The participants (n = 252) completed the Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and wore a waist-mounted accelerometer for 7 days. Participants were divided into 2 groups based on fatigue severity as measured by the FSS scale. We compared percentage of wear time spent in sedentary, light physical activity (LPA), and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) between the 2 groups. Results. Persons in the fatigued group (FSS score ≥ 4) spent a greater percentage of time in sedentary behavior ( P = .004) and a lower percentage of time in LPA ( P = .035). Persons in the fatigued group further spent a lower percentage of time in nontransformed MVPA ( P &lt; .001) and square-root-transformed MVPA ( P &lt; .001) than persons in the nonfatigued group. When controlling for PDDS scores and years of education, there were no longer significant differences between groups in sedentary behavior, LPA, or transformed MVPA values; the difference in nontransformed MVPA was still statistically significant but likely the result of nonnormally distributed data. Conclusion. The present study suggests that factors other than fatigue might be associated with physical activity and sedentary behavior in MS, and this group might benefit from focal behavioral interventions that take into account mobility status in persons with MS who have fatigue.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W1873321488","numberInSourceReferences":90,"doi":"10.1016/J.CLINEURO.2015.07.018","title":"Determinants of physical activity in minimally impaired people with multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Turhan Kahraman","orcid":null,"LN":"Kahraman","FN":"Turhan","affil":"Dokuz Eylül University (TR)","name":"Turhan Kahraman"},{"id":"Sema Savci","orcid":null,"LN":"Savci","FN":"Sema","affil":"Dokuz Eylül University (TR)","name":"Sema Savci"},{"id":"Esra Coskuner-Poyraz","orcid":null,"LN":"Coskuner-Poyraz","FN":"Esra","affil":"Dokuz Eylül University (TR)","name":"Esra Coskuner-Poyraz"},{"id":"Serkan Ozakbas","orcid":null,"LN":"Ozakbas","FN":"Serkan","affil":"Dokuz Eylül University (TR)","name":"Serkan Ozakbas"},{"id":"Egemen Idiman","orcid":null,"LN":"Idiman","FN":"Egemen","affil":"Dokuz Eylül University (TR)","name":"Egemen Idiman"}],"year":2015,"journal":"Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery","references":["W1904453581","W1968578273","W1972535678","W1991460270","W1995110505","W2006779083","W2008609876","W2013441496","W2014133991","W2023687307","W2035219175","W2037674459","W2039648436","W2042166711","W2042870170","W2053092057","W2061178742","W2064625793","W2067801943","W2071298586","W2077136874","W2078594267","W2079258076","W2091844728","W2098014311","W2098217376","W2102129610","W2105490558","W2108230902","W2112165124","W2116416756","W2117405134","W2143567192","W2145481931","W2146042523","W2148930341","W2150378783","W2152787748","W2170249626","W2186884178","W4231959353","W4245666729"],"citationsCount":19,"abstract":"Despite the commonly known benefits of physical activity, evidence shows that people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) are relatively inactive.

Construct validity involves examining the pattern of associations between the SSST and other measures, and precision involves comparing SSST performance relative to other valid measures of ambulation for differentiating between levels of disability status, MS clinical course, and fall risk based on balance confidence.All participants completed the SSST, T25FW, Timed Up-and-Go (TUG), six-minute walk, Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12, Late-Life Function and Disability Inventory, Activities-specific Balance Confidence, and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test. All participants further underwent a neurological examination for generating EDSS scores, and then wore an ActiGraph accelerometer for the waking hours of a 7-day period.SSST performance was strongly associated with other valid measures of ambulation (|ρ| = .65-.90) and disability status (ρ = .73), moderately-to-strongly associated with balance confidence (ρ = .58), and weakly-to-moderately associated with cognitive processing speed and non-ambulatory measures (|ρ| = .35-.39). The SSST demonstrated stronger relative precision in discriminating between levels of disability status, MS clinical course, and fall risk based on balance confidence than the T25FW and TUG.We provide comprehensive validity evidence for the SSST that supports its consideration for inclusion alongside other highly-regarded objective measures of ambulatory function for clinical research and practice in persons with MS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2801163157","numberInSourceReferences":146,"doi":"10.1088/1361-6579/AAC0A3","title":"Wearable technology reveals gait compensations, unstable walking patterns and fatigue in people with multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Michael Psarakis","orcid":null,"LN":"Psarakis","FN":"Michael","affil":"Australian Catholic University (AU)","name":"Michael Psarakis"},{"id":"David L.

Ankle joint contractures in PwMS are common and often result in compensatory gait patterns to accommodate reduced ankle range of motion (ROM).Using advances in wearable technology, the aim of this study was to quantify head and pelvis movement patterns that occur in PwMS with disability and determine how these secondary gait compensations impact on gait stability. Twelve healthy participants and 12 PwMS participated in the study. Head and pelvis movements were measured using two tri-axial accelerometers. Measures of gait compensation, mobility, variability, asymmetry, stability and fatigue were assessed during a 6 min walking test.Compared to healthy controls, PwMS had greater vertical asymmetry in their head and pelvic movements (Cohen's d = 1.85 and 1.60). Lower harmonic ratios indicated that PwMS were more unstable than controls (Cohen's d = -1.61 to -3.06), even after adjusting for their slower walking speeds. In the PwMS, increased compensatory movements were correlated with reduced ankle active ROM (r = -0.71), higher disability (EDSS) scores (r = 0.58), unstable gait (r = -0.76), reduced mobility (r = -0.76) and increased variability (r = 0.83).Wearable device technology provides an efficient and reliable way to screen for excessive compensatory movements often present in PwMS and provides clinically important information that impacts on mobility, stride time variability and gait stability. This information may help clinicians identify PwMS at high risk of falling and develop better rehabilitation interventions that, in addition to improving mobility, may help target the underlying causes of unstable gait.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2113672062","numberInSourceReferences":94,"doi":"10.7224/1537-2073.2014-016","title":"Does the Effect of a Physical Activity Behavioral Intervention Vary by Characteristics of People with Multiple Sclerosis?","authors":[{"id":"Robert W.

Nevertheless, there has been interindividual variability in the pattern and magnitude of change. This study documented the efficacy and variability of a behavioral intervention for changing physical activity and examined the possibility that efficacy varied by the characteristics of individuals with MS. Methods: Eighty-two people with MS were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: behavioral intervention (n = 41) or waitlist control (n = 41). We collected information before the study on MS type, disability status, weight status based on body-mass index, and current medications. Furthermore, all participants completed the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire and the abbreviated International Physical Activity Questionnaire and wore an accelerometer for 1 week to measure minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity before and after the 6-month intervention period. Results: Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) indicated that participants in the behavioral intervention had significantly higher levels of physical activity than control participants after the 6-month period (P &amp;lt; .001). There was substantial interindividual variability in the magnitude of change, and ANCOVA indicated that MS type (relapsing vs. progressive) (P &amp;lt; .01), disability status (mild vs. moderate) (P &amp;lt; .01), and weight status (normal weight vs. overweight/obese) (P &amp;lt; .05) moderated the efficacy of the behavioral intervention.

This prospective study further examined methodological issues influencing the association between physical activity and IPS in 82 persons with MS.  Methods Participants wore an accelerometer during the waking hours over 7 days for measuring physical activity as steps/day and six-months later completed two versions of the SDMT and the PASAT.  Results Steps/day was significantly, moderately, and similarly associated with oral ( r s  = .45, p r s  = .51, p r s  = .23, p  = .02). After controlling for age and disability status as covariates of IPS, the associations among steps/day and oral ( pr s  = .25, p  = .02) and written ( pr s  = .29, p  = .01) SDMT performance were attenuated, but statistically significant, whereas after controlling for age and disability status, the association between steps/day and PASAT performance was not statistically significant ( pr s  = .12, p  = .34).

From this data, we derived five features: path length traveled, time spent in the center of the screen, average distance from the center, average speed while in the center, and number of direction changes underwent by the ball. Time in center proved to be the most sensitive feature to differentiate MS patients from HV and had the strongest correlations with clinician-derived scales. Its superiority was validated in an independent validation cohort of 29 MS patients. A linear combination of different Level features failed to outperform time in center in an independent validation cohort. Limited longitudinal data demonstrated that the Level features were relatively stable intra-individually within 4 months, without definitive evidence of learning. In contrast to previously developed smartphone tests that predominantly measure motoric functions, Level features correlated strongly with reaction time and moderately with cerebellar functions and proprioception, validating its complementary clinical value in the MS app suite. The Level Test measures neurological disability in several domains in two independent cross-sectional cohorts (original and validation). An ongoing longitudinal cohort further investigates whether patient-autonomous collection of granular functional data allows measurement of patient-specific trajectories of disability progression to better guide treatment decisions.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2944542753","numberInSourceReferences":168,"doi":"10.1016/J.DHJO.2019.05.002","title":"Social-cognitive theory variables as correlates of sedentary behavior in multiple sclerosis: Preliminary evidence","authors":[{"id":"Robert W.

Currently clinicians rely on self-report measures or simple functional assessments, administered at discrete time points, to assess fall risk. Wearable inertial sensors are a promising technology for increasing the sensitivity of clinical assessments to accurately predict fall risk, but current accelerometer-based approaches are limited.  Research question Will metrics derived from wearable accelerometers during a 30-second chair stand test (30CST) correlate with clinical measures of disease severity, balance confidence and fatigue in PwMS, and can these metrics be used to accurately discriminate fallers from non-fallers?  Methods Thirty-eight PwMS (21 fallers) completed self-report outcome measures then performed the 30CST while triaxial acceleration data were collected from inertial sensors adhered to the thigh and chest. Accelerometer metrics were derived for the sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transitions and relationships with clinical metrics were assessed. Finally, the metrics were used to develop a logistic regression model to classify fall status.  Results Accelerometer-derived metrics were significantly associated with multiple clinical metrics that capture disease severity, balance confidence and fatigue. Performance of a logistic regression for classifying fall status was enhanced by including accelerometer features (accuracy 74%, AUC 0.78) compared to the standard of care (accuracy 68%, AUC 0.74) or patient reported outcomes (accuracy 71%, AUC 0.75).  Significance Accelerometer derived metrics were associated with clinically relevant measures of disease severity, fatigue and balance confidence during a balance challenging task. Inertial sensors could feasibly be utilized to enhance the accuracy of functional assessments to identify fall risk in PwMS. Simplicity of these accelerometer-based metrics could facilitate deployment for community-based monitoring.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2892120577","numberInSourceReferences":134,"doi":"10.3389/FNEUR.2018.00740","title":"Identifying and Quantifying Neurological Disability via Smartphone","authors":[{"id":"Alexandra Boukhvalova","orcid":null,"LN":"Boukhvalova","FN":"Alexandra","affil":"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (US), National Institutes of Health (US)","name":"Alexandra Boukhvalova"},{"id":"Emily Kowalczyk","orcid":null,"LN":"Kowalczyk","FN":"Emily","affil":"University of Maryland, College Park (US), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (US), National Institutes of Health (US)","name":"Emily Kowalczyk"},{"id":"Thomas M.

We hypothesized that aggregating data from two simple smartphone tests of fine finger movements with differing contribution of specific neurological domains (i.e., strength & cerebellar functions, vision, and reaction time) will allow establishment of secondary outcomes that reflect domain-specific deficit. This hypothesis was tested by assessing correlations of smartphone-derived outcomes with relevant parts of neurological examination in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. We developed MS test suite on Android platform, consisting of several simple functional tests. This paper compares cross-sectional and longitudinal performance of Finger tapping and Balloon popping tests by 76 MS patients and 19 healthy volunteers (HV). The primary outcomes of smartphone tests, the average number of taps (per two 10-s intervals) and the average number of pops (per two 26-s intervals) differentiated MS from HV with similar power to traditional, investigator-administered test of fine finger movements, 9-hole peg test (9HPT). Additionally, the secondary outcomes identified patients with predominant cerebellar dysfunction, motor fatigue and poor eye-hand coordination and/or reaction time, as evidenced by significant correlations between these derived outcomes and relevant parts of neurological examination. The intra-individual variance in longitudinal sampling was low. In the time necessary for performing 9HPT, smartphone tests provide much richer and reliable measurements of several distinct neurological functions. These data suggest that combing more creatively-construed smartphone apps may one day recreate the entire neurological examination.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2154719837","numberInSourceReferences":57,"doi":"10.1177/1352458513475832","title":"Perceived and actual arm performance in multiple sclerosis: relationship with clinical tests according to hand dominance","authors":[{"id":"Ilse Lamers","orcid":"0000-0001-6147-4769","LN":"Lamers","FN":"Ilse","affil":"Hasselt University (BE)","name":"Ilse Lamers"},{"id":"Lore Kerkhofs","orcid":null,"LN":"Kerkhofs","FN":"Lore","affil":"#N#            3Rehabilitation and MS Center, Overpelt, Belgium","name":"Lore Kerkhofs"},{"id":"Joke Raats","orcid":null,"LN":"Raats","FN":"Joke","affil":"#N#            4De Mick, Rehabilitation Center, Brasschaat, Belgium","name":"Joke Raats"},{"id":"Daphne Kos","orcid":null,"LN":"Kos","FN":"Daphne","affil":"KU Leuven (BE)","name":"Daphne Kos"},{"id":"Bart Van Wijmeersch","orcid":null,"LN":"Wijmeersch","FN":"Bart Van","affil":"Hasselt University (BE)","name":"Bart Van Wijmeersch"},{"id":"Peter Feys","orcid":null,"LN":"Feys","FN":"Peter","affil":"Hasselt University (BE)","name":"Peter Feys"}],"year":2013,"journal":"Multiple Sclerosis Journal","references":["W1582135187","W1696095905","W1752985724","W1966953701","W1977005542","W1995110505","W1999593591","W2014857359","W2018187525","W2048591099","W2052105544","W2053812450","W2057980146","W2058250069","W2066091146","W2074172762","W2098421679","W2104610767","W2105490558","W2106236488","W2112165124","W2119292054","W2130734445","W2130873978","W2132923627","W2133236154","W2136361599","W2141062585","W2146660117","W2148677082","W2153523054","W2154697418","W2155175837","W2158177758","W2161719272","W2414795604"],"citationsCount":46,"abstract":"Background: The real-life relevance of frequently applied clinical arm tests is not well known in multiple sclerosis (MS). Objective: This study aimed to determine the relation between real-life arm performance and clinical tests in MS. Methods: Thirty wheelchair-bound MS patients and 30 healthy controls were included. Actual and perceived real-life arm performance was measured by using accelerometry and a self-reported measure (Motor Activity Log). Clinical tests on ‘body functions &amp; structures’ (JAMAR handgrip strength, Motricity Index (MI), Fugl Meyer (FM)) and ‘activity’ level (Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT), Action Research Arm test) of the International Classification of Functioning were conducted. Statistical analyses were performed separately for current dominant and non-dominant arm. Results: For all outcome measures, MS patients scored with both arms significantly lower than the control group. Higher correlations between actual arm performance and clinical tests were found for the non-dominant arm (0.63–0.80). The FM (55%) was a good predictor of actual arm performance, while the MI (46%) and NHPT (55%) were good predictors of perceived arm performance. Conclusions: Real-life arm performance is decreased in wheelchair-bound MS patients and can be best predicted by measures on ‘body functions &amp; structures’ level and fine motor control. Hand dominance influenced the magnitude of relationships.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2039648436","numberInSourceReferences":22,"doi":"10.1097/MRR.0B013E328325A5ED","title":"Preliminary evidence that self-efficacy predicts physical activity in multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Robert W.

METHODS Consecutive patients meeting the 2010 MS diagnostic criteria and healthy controls were offered enrollment. Participants completed finger and foot taps wearing the MYO-band© (accelerometer, gyroscope, and surface electromyogram sensors). Signal processing was performed to extract spatiotemporal features from raw sensor data. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) assessed intertest reproducibility. Spearman correlation and multivariable regression methods compared extracted features to physician- and patient-reported disability outcomes. Partial least squares regression identified the most informative extracted textural features. RESULTS Baseline data for 117 participants with MS (EDSS 1.0-7.0) and 30 healthy controls were analyzed. ICCs for final selected features ranged from 0.80 to 0.87. Time-based features distinguished cases from controls (P = 0.002). The most informative combination of extracted features from all three sensors strongly correlated with physician EDSS (finger taps rs  = 0.77, P < 0.0001; foot taps rs  = 0.82, P < 0.0001) and had equally strong associations with patient-reported outcomes (WHODAS, finger taps rs  = 0.82, P < 0.0001; foot taps rs  = 0.82, P < 0.0001). Associations remained with multivariable modeling adjusted for age and sex. CONCLUSIONS Extracted features from the multi-sensor demonstrate striking correlations with gold standard outcomes. Ideal for future generalizability, the assessments take only a few minutes, can be performed by nonclinical personnel, and wearing the band is nondisruptive to routine practice. This novel paradigm holds promise as a new neurological vital sign.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2885458150","numberInSourceReferences":133,"doi":"10.1186/S12883-018-1111-7","title":"Wearables for gait and balance assessment in the neurological ward - study design and first results of a prospective cross-sectional feasibility study with 384 inpatients","authors":[{"id":"Felix P.

New assessment options using wearables may provide complementary and more objective information.In this prospective cross-sectional feasibility study performed over a four-month period, all patients referred to a normal neurology ward of a university hospital and aged between 40 and 89 years were asked to participate. Gait and balance deficits were assessed with wearables at the ankles and the lower back. Frailty, sarcopenia, Parkinsonism, depression, quality of life, fall history, fear of falling, physical activity, and cognition were evaluated with questionnaires and surveys.Eighty-two percent (n = 384) of all eligible patients participated. Of those, 39% (n = 151) had no gait and balance deficit, 21% (n = 79) had gait deficits, 11% (n = 44) had balance deficits and 29% (n = 110) had gait and balance deficits. Parkinson's disease, stroke, epilepsy, pain syndromes, and multiple sclerosis were the most common diseases. The assessment was well accepted.Our study suggests that the use of wearables for the assessment of gait and balance features in a clinical setting is feasible. Moreover, preliminary results confirm previous epidemiological data about gait and balance deficits among neurological inpatients. Evaluation of neurological inpatients with novel wearable technology opens new opportunities for the assessment of predictive, progression and treatment response markers.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2112983587","numberInSourceReferences":67,"doi":"10.1186/1743-0003-11-67","title":"Quantitative assessment of upper limb motor function in Multiple Sclerosis using an instrumented Action Research Arm Test","authors":[{"id":"Ilaria Carpinella","orcid":"0000-0001-7486-0706","LN":"Carpinella","FN":"Ilaria","affil":"Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation (IT), Istituti di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IT)","name":"Ilaria Carpinella"},{"id":"Davide Cattaneo","orcid":null,"LN":"Cattaneo","FN":"Davide","affil":"Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation (IT)","name":"Davide Cattaneo"},{"id":"Maurizio Ferrarin","orcid":null,"LN":"Ferrarin","FN":"Maurizio","affil":"Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation (IT), Istituti di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IT)","name":"Maurizio Ferrarin"}],"year":2014,"journal":"Journal of Neuroengineering and Rehabilitation","references":["W1752985724","W1970056945","W1971255930","W1985119666","W1994541041","W2013938351","W2015428234","W2030747368","W2036581929","W2040085431","W2058250069","W2071442786","W2085126485","W2093375256","W2097919178","W2098661447","W2099410753","W2105490558","W2105777811","W2106236488","W2108479646","W2112165124","W2114698100","W2131368080","W2131708822","W2136361599","W2142887818","W2145016488","W2150377812","W2153523054","W2155067987","W2167271993","W2169649488"],"citationsCount":80,"abstract":"Arm impairment in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is commonly assessed with clinical scales, such as Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) which evaluates the ability to handle and transport smaller and larger objects. ARAT provides a complete upper limb assessment, as it considers both proximal arm and hand, but suffers from subjectivity and poor sensitivity to mild impairment. In this study an instrumented ARAT is proposed to overcome these limitations and supplement the assessment of arm function in MS.ARAT was executed by 12 healthy volunteers and 21 MS subjects wearing a single inertial sensor on the wrist. Accelerometers and gyroscopes signals were used to calculate the duration of each task and its sub-phases (reaching, manipulation, transport, release and return). A jerk index was computed to quantify movement smoothness. For each parameter, z-scores were calculated to analyze the deviation from normative data. MS subjects were clinically assessed with ARAT score, Nine-Hole Peg test (9HPT) and Fahn Tremor Rating Scale (FTRS).ARAT tasks executed by MS patients were significantly slower (duration increase: 70%) and less smooth (jerk increase: 16%) with respect to controls. These anomalies were mainly related to manipulation, transport and release sub-movements, with the former showing the greatest alterations. A statistically significant decrease in movement velocity and smoothness was also noticed in patients with normal ARAT score. Z-scores related to duration and jerk were strongly correlated with ARAT rating (r < -0.80, p < 0.001) and 9HPT (r < -0.75, p < 0.001) and were significantly different among MS sub-groups with different levels of arm impairments (p < 0.001). Moreover, Z-score related to manipulation-phase jerk was significantly correlated with the FTRS rating of intention tremor (r = 0.84, p < 0.001).The present study showed that the proposed method is able to discriminate between control and MS groups and to reveal subtle arm alterations not detectable from ARAT score. Validity was shown by high correlations between instrumental variables and clinical ratings. These results suggested that instrumented ARAT could be a valid quick and easy-to-use method for a sensitive quantification of arm function in MS. Inclusion of finger-mounted sensors could complement present findings and provide further indications about hand function in MS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3013658229","numberInSourceReferences":201,"doi":"10.1017/S1355617720000284","title":"Device-Measured Physical Activity and Cognitive Processing Speed Impairment in a Large Sample of Persons with Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Brian M.

However, one overarching limitation of this research is that researchers have not recruited samples who have the actual problem of being studied (i.e., cognitive processing speed impairment). This study examined associations between device-measured PA and cognitive processing speed in a large sample of persons with MS overall and between those with and without cognitive processing speed impairment. Method: Three hundred eighty-five persons with MS underwent the oral Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and wore an accelerometer for 7 days for PA measurement. We divided the overall sample into subsamples with ( n = 140) and without ( n = 245) cognitive processing speed impairment based on age, sex, and education-adjusted SDMT Z -scores. Results: After controlling for age and disability status, higher levels of device-measured PA were significantly associated with faster cognitive processing speed overall, and the association was significantly stronger among persons with MS who presented with cognitive processing speed impairment. Conclusions: This examination provides initial cross-sectional support for informing the development of PA interventions as a possible approach for managing MS-related cognitive processing speed impairment. This highlights the importance of developing purposefully designed trials involving PA interventions for targeting cognitive processing speed as a primary end point among persons with MS with impaired cognitive processing speed.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3201477013","numberInSourceReferences":258,"doi":"10.2196/30394","title":"Practice Effects of Mobile Tests of Cognition, Dexterity, and Mobility on Patients With Multiple Sclerosis: Data Analysis of a Smartphone-Based Observational Study","authors":[{"id":"Tim Woelfle","orcid":"0000-0001-6279-4158","LN":"Woelfle","FN":"Tim","affil":"University Hospital of Basel (CH), University of Basel (CH)","name":"Tim Woelfle"},{"id":"Silvan Pless","orcid":null,"LN":"Pless","FN":"Silvan","affil":"University Hospital of Basel (CH), University of Basel (CH)","name":"Silvan Pless"},{"id":"Andrea Wiencierz","orcid":null,"LN":"Wiencierz","FN":"Andrea","affil":"University Hospital of Basel (CH), University of Basel (CH)","name":"Andrea Wiencierz"},{"id":"Ludwig Kappos","orcid":null,"LN":"Kappos","FN":"Ludwig","affil":"University Hospital of Basel (CH), University of Basel (CH)","name":"Ludwig Kappos"},{"id":"Yvonne Naegelin","orcid":"0000-0002-1315-4100","LN":"Naegelin","FN":"Yvonne","affil":"University Hospital of Basel (CH), University of Basel (CH)","name":"Yvonne Naegelin"},{"id":"Johannes Lorscheider","orcid":"0000-0003-1100-2506","LN":"Lorscheider","FN":"Johannes","affil":"University Hospital of Basel (CH), University of Basel (CH)","name":"Johannes Lorscheider"}],"year":2021,"journal":"Journal of Medical Internet Research","references":["W1978387859","W2009499611","W2014127183","W2027285375","W2040430789","W2055670101","W2060934370","W2100192820","W2119629949","W2132417892","W2144328025","W2168089704","W2191952236","W2527465987","W2588292672","W2588488142","W2589005373","W2612175040","W2737503982","W2801834301","W2970657297","W2974007026","W3008688529","W3047026678","W3083694354","W3097413421","W3112717819","W3121280403","W3156516681","W3165016634","W3180418879"],"citationsCount":7,"abstract":"Smartphones and their built-in sensors allow for measuring functions in disease-related domains through mobile tests. This could improve disease characterization and monitoring, and could potentially support treatment decisions for multiple sclerosis (MS), a multifaceted chronic neurological disease with highly variable clinical manifestations. Practice effects can complicate the interpretation of both improvement over time by potentially exaggerating treatment effects and stability by masking deterioration.The aim of this study is to identify short-term learning and long-term practice effects in 6 active tests for cognition, dexterity, and mobility in user-scheduled, high-frequency smartphone-based testing.We analyzed data from 264 people with self-declared MS with a minimum of 5 weeks of follow-up and at least 5 repetitions per test in the Floodlight Open study, a self-enrollment study accessible by smartphone owners from 16 countries. The collected data are openly available to scientists. Using regression and bounded growth mixed models, we characterized practice effects for the following tests: electronic Symbol Digit Modalities Test (e-SDMT) for cognition; Finger Pinching and Draw a Shape for dexterity; and Two Minute Walk, U-Turn, and Static Balance for mobility.Strong practice effects were found for e-SDMT (n=4824 trials), Finger Pinching (n=19,650), and Draw a Shape (n=19,019) with modeled boundary improvements of 40.8% (39.9%-41.6%), 86.2% (83.6%-88.7%), and 23.1% (20.9%-25.2%) over baseline, respectively. Half of the practice effect was reached after 11 repetitions for e-SDMT, 28 repetitions for Finger Pinching, and 17 repetitions for Draw a Shape; 90% was reached after 35, 94, and 56 repetitions, respectively. Although baseline performance levels were highly variable across participants, no significant differences between the short-term learning effects in low performers (5th and 25th percentile), median performers, and high performers (75th and 95th percentile) were found for e-SDMT up to the fifth trial (β=1.50-2.00). Only small differences were observed for Finger Pinching (β=1.25-2.5). For U-Turn (n=15,051) and Static Balance (n=16,797), only short-term learning effects could be observed, which ceased after a maximum of 5 trials. For Two Minute Walk (n=14,393), neither short-term learning nor long-term practice effects were observed.Smartphone-based tests are promising for monitoring the disease trajectories of MS and other chronic neurological diseases. Our findings suggest that strong long-term practice effects in cognitive and dexterity functions have to be accounted for to identify disease-related changes in these domains, especially in the context of personalized health and in studies without a comparator arm. In contrast, changes in mobility may be more easily interpreted because of the absence of long-term practice effects, even though short-term learning effects might have to be considered.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3107225396","numberInSourceReferences":247,"doi":"10.1016/J.GAITPOST.2020.11.024","title":"Does gait bout definition influence the ability to discriminate gait quality between people with and without multiple sclerosis during daily life?","authors":[{"id":"Vrutangkumar V.

It is also not known how different definitions of a gait bout in daily life monitoring affects the ability to distinguish pathological gait quality. Specifically, how many seconds of a pause with no walking indicates an end to one gait bout and the start of another bout? In this study, we investigated the effect of 3 gait bout definitions on the discriminative ability to distinguish quality of walking in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) from healthy control subjects (HC) during a week of daily living.15 subjects with MS and 16 HC wore instrumented socks on each foot and one Opal sensor over the lower lumbar area for a week of daily activities for at least 8 h/day. Three gait bout definitions were based on the length of the pause between the end of one gait bout and start of another bout (1.25 s, 2.50 s, and 5.0 s pause). Area under the curve (AUC) was used to compare gait quality measures in MS versus HC.Total number of gait bouts over the week were statistically significantly different across bout definitions, as expected. However, AUCs of gait quality measures (such as gait speed, stride length, stride time) discriminating people with MS from HC were not different despite the 3 bout definitions.Quality of gait measures that discriminate MS from HC during daily life are not influenced by the length of a gait bout, despite large differences in quantity of gait across bout definitions. Thus, gait quality measures in people with MS versus controls can be compared across studies using different gait bout definitions with pause lengths ≤5 s.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2006154774","numberInSourceReferences":73,"doi":"10.1016/J.MSARD.2013.06.014","title":"Accelerometer measured physical activity and the integrity of the anterior visual pathway in multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Brian M.

Statistical analysis first defined Change Groups on the basis of the performance-based accelerometer scores, anchored to 0.5 standard deviation change; then change was defined on the basis of published and linked MIDs for the PROs.The performance-based (accelerometer) and PRO-based change distributions were stable over time. Raw scores among the accelerometer and PRO measures were associated with large effect sizes, and PRO change scores were associated with each other but not with accelerometer change scores.These findings contradict a central assumption that may underlie clinical research studies: that a cross-sectional correlation implies that change in PROs will correspond with change in behavior/performance.

Thirty-seven PwMS (21 fallers) performed instrumented supervised and unsupervised 30CSTs with a single wearable sensor on the thigh. In unsupervised conditions, participants performed bi-hourly 30CSTs and rated their balance confidence and fatigue over 48-hours. ROC analysis was used to classify fall status for 30CST performance. Non-fallers (p = 0.02) but not fallers (p = 0.23) differed in their average unsupervised 30CST performance (repetitions) compared to their supervised performance. The unsupervised maximum number of 30CST repetitions performed optimized ROC classification AUC (0.79), accuracy (78.4%) and specificity (90.0%) for fall status with an optimal cutoff of 17 repetitions. Brief durations of instrumented unsupervised monitoring as an adjunct to routine clinical assessments could improve the ability for predicting fall risk and fluctuations in functional mobility in PwMS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2790774917","numberInSourceReferences":139,"doi":"10.3138/PTC.2017-36.EP","title":"Correlating the Physical Activity Patterns of People with Moderate to Severe Multiple Sclerosis Disability and Their Family Caregivers","authors":[{"id":"Afolasade Fakolade","orcid":null,"LN":"Fakolade","FN":"Afolasade","affil":"School of Rehabilitation Therapy.","name":"Afolasade Fakolade"},{"id":"Marcia Finlayson","orcid":null,"LN":"Finlayson","FN":"Marcia","affil":"School of Rehabilitation Therapy.","name":"Marcia Finlayson"},{"id":"Trisha Parsons","orcid":null,"LN":"Parsons","FN":"Trisha","affil":"School of Rehabilitation Therapy.","name":"Trisha Parsons"},{"id":"Amy E Latimer-Cheung","orcid":null,"LN":"Latimer-Cheung","FN":"Amy E","affil":"Queen's University (CA)","name":"Amy E Latimer-Cheung"}],"year":2018,"journal":"Physiotherapy Canada","references":["W1604376790","W1966335503","W1966779163","W1970198083","W1978438866","W1980405237","W1993547045","W1996254614","W2001995889","W2008026996","W2008166065","W2010204683","W2027173102","W2028842616","W2038203065","W2040425484","W2050107966","W2069626739","W2077730410","W2086261838","W2095534499","W2096987797","W2107472341","W2107813574","W2108481900","W2110595629","W2110759991","W2111010616","W2114335295","W2114881233","W2114918377","W2120620067","W2121149730","W2122401765","W2126972762","W2143441850","W2144801891","W2152193038","W2153262331","W2156879797","W2167776023","W2184938739","W2285745198","W2404519457","W2415438560","W2574394740","W2582033457","W2750840957","W4299627282"],"citationsCount":9,"abstract":"Purpose: People with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and their family caregivers often react to the impact of the disease as an interdependent dyad. The aim of this exploratory study was to examine interdependence in the physical activity (PA) patterns of dyads affected by moderate to severe MS disability. Method: A total of 15 pairs of PwMS and their family caregivers wore accelerometers for 7 days. By collecting data simultaneously from both partners, we tested interdependence using the dyad as the unit of analysis. Results: PwMS and caregivers averaged 4,091.3 (SD 2,726.3) and 6,160.2 (SD 1,653.0) steps per day, respectively. The mean number of minutes per day of sedentary, light, and moderate to vigorous activity for PwMS was 566.3 (SD 97.7), 167.4 (SD 94.0), and 7.6 (SD 12.4), respectively, and 551.9 (SD 92.4), 199.6 (SD 63.4), and 21.4 (SD 18.2), respectively, for caregivers. Interdependence between dyads for sedentary, light, moderate to vigorous activity, and step count was low and non-significant (rs=0.20, 0.26, 0.13, and –0.27, respectively; p&gt;0.05). Conclusions: Although our findings do not support the interdependence of PA between caregivers and care recipients with MS, they do show that both partners are not engaging in sufficient PA to achieve important health benefits. These findings are important because they indicate that the dyads are likely to benefit from interventions for changing PA behavior.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2606530149","numberInSourceReferences":116,"doi":"10.1016/J.MEDENGPHY.2017.03.008","title":"Validity of the activPAL3 activity monitor in people moderately affected by Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Elaine H.

The aim of this study was to assess the criterion validity of the activPAL3 activity monitor during overground walking in people with MS. Validity of the activPAL3 accelerometer was compared to video observation in 20 people moderately affected by MS. Participants walked 20-30m twice along a straight quiet corridor at a comfortable speed. Inter-rater reliability of video observations was excellent (all intraclass correlations >0.99). The mean difference (activPAL3- mean of raters) was -4.70±9.09, -4.55s±10.76 and 1.11s±1.11 for steps taken, walking duration and upright duration respectively. These differences represented 8.7%, 10.0% and 1.8% of the mean for each measure respectively. The activPAL3 tended to underestimate steps taken and walking duration in those who walked at cadences of ≤38 steps/min by 60% and 47%, respectively. The activPAL3 is valid for measuring walking activity in people moderately affected by MS. It is accurate for upright duration regardless of cadence. In participants with slow walking cadences, outcomes of steps taken and walking duration should be interpreted with caution.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2009638659","numberInSourceReferences":91,"doi":"10.3109/09638288.2015.1019008","title":"Effects of balance-specific exercises on balance, physical activity and quality of life in adults with multiple sclerosis: a pilot investigation","authors":[{"id":"Susan L.

ANOVA were used to evaluate the effects of testing session on the Brief-BESTest, instrumented stance and gait recordings by inertial motion sensors, lower-limb strength recorded by force transducers, accelerometry-based activity, the 12-item MS Walking Scale (MSWS-12), the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQOL-54) questionnaire, the Modified Fatigue Impact scale (MFIS) and the Activity-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale.The intervention associated with significantly improved scores on the MSQOL-54 mental component, MFIS, MSWS-12 and Brief-BESTest. Sway amplitude significantly decreased and jerk significantly increased during instrumented standing on foam with eyes closed. Instrumented gait recordings of sagittal trunk range of motion also significantly decreased.

A future randomized, controlled clinical trial should confirm these preliminary findings. Implications for Rehabilitation A balance-specific exercise program is both safe and feasible for individuals with mild-to-moderate MS. Comprehensive exercise interventions that are conceptually driven and employ well-designed progressive exercise across multiple contexts of balance control can facilitate improvements in balance impairments associated with MS.

Further, a potential correlation between gait parameters and subjective fatigue was explored.Automated gait analyses were carried out on 88 MS patients and 31 healthy participants. To measure gait parameters (i.e. walking speed, stride length, stride duration, duration of stance and swing phase, minimal toe-to-floor distance), wearable inertial sensors were utilized throughout a 6-min 25-ft walk. Additionally, self-reported subjective fatigue was assessed.Mean gait parameters consistently revealed significant differences between healthy participants and MS patients from as early as an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) value of 1.5 onwards. Further, MS patients showed a significant linear trend in all parameters, reflecting continuously deteriorating gait performance throughout the test. This linear deterioration trend showed significant correlations with fatigue.Wearable inertial sensors are highly sensitive in the detection of gait disturbances, even in early MS, where global scales such as the EDSS do not provide any clinical information about deviations in gait behavior. Moreover, these measures provide a linear trend parameter of gait deterioration that may serve as a surrogate marker of fatigue. In sum, these results suggest that classic timed walking tests in routine clinical practice should be replaced by readily and automatically applicable gait assessments, as provided by inertial sensors.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3093779021","numberInSourceReferences":200,"doi":"10.2196/22108","title":"Evaluating the Utility of Smartphone-Based Sensor Assessments in Persons With Multiple Sclerosis in the Real-World Using an App (elevateMS): Observational, Prospective Pilot Digital Health Study","authors":[{"id":"Abhishek Pratap","orcid":"0000-0002-5289-6932","LN":"Pratap","FN":"Abhishek","affil":"Sage Bionetworks (US)","name":"Abhishek Pratap"},{"id":"Daniel J.

Current monitoring practices predominantly rely on brief and infrequent assessments, which may not be representative of the real-world patient experience. Smartphone technology provides an opportunity to assess people’s daily-lived experience of MS on a frequent, regular basis outside of episodic clinical evaluations. Objective The objectives of this study were to evaluate the feasibility and utility of capturing real-world MS-related health data remotely using a smartphone app, “elevateMS,” to investigate the associations between self-reported MS severity and sensor-based active functional tests measurements, and the impact of local weather conditions on disease burden. Methods This was a 12-week, observational, digital health study involving 3 cohorts: self-referred participants who reported an MS diagnosis, clinic-referred participants with neurologist-confirmed MS, and participants without MS (controls). Participants downloaded the elevateMS app and completed baseline assessments, including self-reported physical ability (Patient-Determined Disease Steps [PDDS]), as well as longitudinal assessments of quality of life (Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders [Neuro-QoL] Cognitive, Upper Extremity, and Lower Extremity Function) and daily health (MS symptoms, triggers, health, mobility, pain). Participants also completed functional tests (finger-tapping, walk and balance, voice-based Digit Symbol Substitution Test [DSST], and finger-to-nose) as an independent assessment of MS-related cognition and motor activity. Local weather data were collected each time participants completed an active task. Associations between self-reported baseline/longitudinal assessments, functional tests, and weather were evaluated using linear (for cross-sectional data) and mixed-effects (for longitudinal data) regression models. Results A total of 660 individuals enrolled in the study; 31 withdrew, 495 had MS (n=359 self-referred, n=136 clinic-referred), and 134 were controls. Participation was highest in clinic-referred versus self-referred participants (median retention: 25.5 vs 7.0 days). The top 5 most common MS symptoms, reported at least once by participants with MS, were fatigue (310/495, 62.6%), weakness (222/495, 44.8%), memory/attention issues (209/495, 42.2%), and difficulty walking (205/495, 41.4%), and the most common triggers were high ambient temperature (259/495, 52.3%), stress (250/495, 50.5%), and late bedtime (221/495, 44.6%). Baseline PDDS was significantly associated with functional test performance in participants with MS (mixed model–based estimate of most significant feature across functional tests [β]: finger-tapping: β=–43.64, P&lt;.001; DSST: β=–5.47, P=.005; walk and balance: β=–.39, P=.001; finger-to-nose: β=.01, P=.01). Longitudinal Neuro-QoL scores were also significantly associated with functional tests (finger-tapping with Upper Extremity Function: β=.40, P&lt;.001; walk and balance with Lower Extremity Function: β=–99.18, P=.02; DSST with Cognitive Function: β=1.60, P=.03). Finally, local temperature was significantly associated with participants’ test performance (finger-tapping: β=–.14, P&lt;.001; DSST: β=–.06, P=.009; finger-to-nose: β=–53.88, P&lt;.001). Conclusions The elevateMS study app captured the real-world experience of MS, characterized some MS symptoms, and assessed the impact of environmental factors on symptom severity. Our study provides further evidence that supports smartphone app use to monitor MS with both active assessments and patient-reported measures of disease burden. App-based tracking may provide unique and timely real-world data for clinicians and patients, resulting in improved disease insights and management.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3019558441","numberInSourceReferences":211,"doi":"10.3389/FNEUR.2020.00261","title":"Personalized Template-Based Step Detection From Inertial Measurement Units Signals in Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Aliénor Vienne-Jumeau","orcid":null,"LN":"Vienne-Jumeau","FN":"Aliénor","affil":"Délégation Paris 5 (FR), French Defence Health Service (FR)","name":"Aliénor Vienne-Jumeau"},{"id":"Laurent Oudre","orcid":null,"LN":"Oudre","FN":"Laurent","affil":"CMLA (UMR 8536), CNRS ENS Paris-Saclay, Cachan, France., Délégation Paris 5 (FR), French Defence Health Service (FR)","name":"Laurent Oudre"},{"id":"Albane Moreau","orcid":null,"LN":"Moreau","FN":"Albane","affil":"Hôpital d'instruction des Armées Percy (FR), French Defence Health Service (FR)","name":"Albane Moreau"},{"id":"Flavien Quijoux","orcid":"0000-0002-9842-2361","LN":"Quijoux","FN":"Flavien","affil":"Délégation Paris 5 (FR), French Defence Health Service (FR)","name":"Flavien Quijoux"},{"id":"Sébastien Edmond","orcid":null,"LN":"Edmond","FN":"Sébastien","affil":"Hôpital d'instruction des Armées Percy (FR), French Defence Health Service (FR)","name":"Sébastien Edmond"},{"id":"M.

Inertial measurement units (IMUs) provide reliable and yet easy quantitative gait assessment in routine clinical settings. However, to the best of our knowledge, no automated step-detection algorithm performs well in detecting severely altered pMS gait. Method: This article elaborates on a step-detection method based on personalized templates tested against a gold standard. Twenty-two individuals with pMS and 10 young healthy subjects (HSs) were instructed to walk on an electronic walkway wearing synchronized IMUs. Templates were derived from the IMU signals by using Initial and Final Contact times given by the walkway. These were used to detect steps from other gait trials of the same individual (intra-individual template-based detection, IITD) or another participant from the same group (pMS or HS) (intra-group template-based detection, IGTD). All participants were seen twice with a 6-month interval, with two measurements performed at each visit. Performance and accuracy metrics were computed, along with a similarity index (SId), which was computed as the mean distance between detected steps and their respective closest template. Results: For HS participants, both the IITD and the IGTD algorithms had precision and recall of 1.00 for detecting steps. For pMS participants, precision and recall ranged from 0.94 to 1.00 for IITD and 0.85 to 0.95 for IGTD depending on the level of disability. The SId was correlated with performance and the accuracy of the result. An SId threshold of 0.957 (IITD) and 0.963 (IGTD) could rule out decreased performance (F-measure ≤ 0.95), with negative predictive values of 0.99 and 0.96 with the IITD and IGTD algorithms. Also, the SId computed with the IITD and IGTD algorithms could distinguish individuals showing changes at 6-month follow-up. Conclusion: This personalized step-detection method has high performance for detecting steps in pMS individuals with severely altered gait. The algorithm can be self-evaluating with the SI, which gives a measure of the confidence the clinician can have in the detection. What is more, the SId can be used as a biomarker of change in disease severity occurring between the two measurement times.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2564043558","numberInSourceReferences":115,"doi":"10.1016/J.MSARD.2016.12.010","title":"The association between physical activity and sleep characteristics in people with multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Alham Al-Sharman","orcid":null,"LN":"Al-Sharman","FN":"Alham","affil":"Jordan University of Science and Technology (JO)","name":"Alham Al-Sharman"},{"id":"Hanan Khalil","orcid":null,"LN":"Khalil","FN":"Hanan","affil":"Jordan University of Science and Technology (JO)","name":"Hanan Khalil"},{"id":"Mahmoud A.

We hypothesized that physical activity might be a correlate of anxiety and depression in early MS and that this association might be indirect and accounted for by disability.The sample included 96 individuals with a mean duration of MS of 3.0 years (SD =1.5, range=0.5-5 years). The participants wore an accelerometer for 7 days as an objective measure of physical activity and then completed the Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).Descriptive analysis indicated that 41% and 43% of the sample had elevated levels of anxiety and depression, respectively, based on HADS scores (i.e., score ≥8). Correlation analysis indicated that physical activity was significantly associated with depression (r=-0.25; ρ=-.23), but not anxiety (r=-0.05; ρ=-.02). Path analysis indicated that the association between physical activity and depression was entirely indirect by way of disability (path coefficient=-0.23).Such results suggest that physical activity could be an important health promoting behavior for reducing depression in the early stages of MS and this should be the focus of subsequent randomized controlled clinical trials.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3208122070","numberInSourceReferences":291,"doi":"10.1111/ENE.15162","title":"Smartphone‐derived keystroke dynamics are sensitive to relevant changes in multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"K.Y.

Keyboard interactions were unobtrusively collected during typing using the Neurokeys App. From these interactions 15 keystroke features were derived and aggregated using 16 summary and time series statistics. Responsiveness of KD to clinical anchor-based change was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The optimal cut-point was used to determine the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) and compared to the smallest real change (SRC). Commonly used clinical measures were analyzed for comparison.A total of 94 patients completed the follow-up. The five best performing keystroke features had AUC-values in the range 0.72-0.78 for change in gadolinium-enhancing lesions, 0.67-0.70 for the Checklist Individual Strength Fatigue subscale, 0.66-0.79 for the Expanded Disability Status Scale, 0.69-0.73 for the Ambulation Functional System, and 0.72-0.75 for Arm function in MS Questionnaire. The MCID of these features exceeded the SRC on group level. KD had higher AUC-values than comparative clinical measures for the study outcomes, aside from ambulatory function.Keystroke dynamics demonstrated good responsiveness to changes in disease activity, fatigue, and clinical disability in MS, and detected important change beyond measurement error on group level.

This study aims to evaluate the effect of a tailored activity pacing intervention on fatigue and physical activity behaviours in adults with multiple sclerosis. Twenty-one adults with multiple sclerosis, stratified by age and gender, are randomly allocated to either a tailored pacing or control group. Participants wear an accelerometer for seven days that measures physical activity behaviours, and self-report fatigue at the baseline and four-week follow-up. Physical activity behaviours are assessed by examining activity level (seven-day average activity counts per minute) and activity variability (seven-day average highest activity counts each day divided by activity counts on that day). The intervention improves activity levels (Mean difference = 40.91; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] (3.84–77.96); p = 0.03) and lessens activity variability (Mean difference = −0.63; 95% CI (−1.25–0.02); p = 0.04). No significant effect is found for fatigue (Mean difference = −0.36; 95% CI (−1.02–0.30); p = 0.27).

However, objective assessment of balance usually requires clinical expertise and/or the use of expensive and obtrusive measuring equipment. These barriers to the objective assessment of balance may be overcome with the development of a lightweight inertial sensor system. In this study, we examined the concurrent validity of a novel wireless, skin-mounted inertial sensor system (BioStamp®, MC10 Inc.) to measure postural sway in individuals with MS by comparing measurement agreement between this novel sensor and gold standard measurement tools (force plate and externally validated inertial sensor). A total of 39 individuals with MS and 15 healthy controls participated in the study. Participants with MS were divided into groups based on the amount of impairment (MS&lt;sub&gt;Mild&lt;/sub&gt;: EDSS 2–4, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 19; MS&lt;sub&gt;Severe&lt;/sub&gt;: EDSS ≥6, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20). The balance assessment consisted of two 30-s quiet standing trials in each of three conditions: eyes open/firm surface, eyes closed/firm surface, and eyes open/foam surface. For each trial, postural sway was recorded with a force plate (Bertec) and simultaneously using two accelerometers (BioStamp and Xsens) mounted on the participant’s posterior trunk at L5. Sway metrics (sway area, sway path length, root mean square amplitude, mean velocity, JERK, and total power) were derived to compare the measurement agreement among the measurement devices. Excellent agreement (intraclass correlation coefficients &amp;#x3e;0.9) between sway metrics derived from the BioStamp and the MTx sensors were observed across all conditions and groups. Good to excellent correlations (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; &amp;#x3e;0.7) between devices were observed in all sway metrics and conditions. Additionally, the acceleration sway metrics were nearly as effective as the force plate sway metrics in differentiating individuals with poor balance from healthy controls. Overall, the BioStamp sensor is a valid and objective measurement tool for postural sway assessment. This novel, lightweight and portable sensor may offer unique advantages in tracking patient’s postural performance.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2065731896","numberInSourceReferences":38,"doi":"10.1080/08964289.2011.636769","title":"Increasing Physical Activity in Multiple Sclerosis Using a Behavioral Intervention","authors":[{"id":"Robert W.

Accelerometric (ACC) and electromyographic (EMG) recordings were performed in 26 MS patients complaining of clumsiness, associated (n = 16) or not associated (n = 10) with visible tremor. Seventeen healthy subjects with physiological tremor (PT) and eight patients with essential tremor (ET) served as controls. Signals were analyzed using non-linear Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and related Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT), compared to the standard linear spectral analysis using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The presence of cerebellar signs and motor deficit was assessed on clinical examination. Using FFT, tremor was found in all patients with ET and 12% of subjects with PT, but in none of the MS patients, even in the presence of visible tremor. In contrast, EMD-HHT analysis of ACC-EMG coupling showed common frequency peaks characterizing tremor related to a central generator in 62.5% of MS patients with visible tremor, 40% of MS patients without visible tremor, 29% of subjects with PT, and all patients with ET. In EMD-HHT analysis, tremor characteristics were similar in subjects with PT and MS patients, regardless of the presence of a visible tremor, but these characteristics clearly differed in patients with ET. A visible tremor in MS patients was associated with more frequent cerebellar signs and less motor deficit at the upper limb. The low-frequency tremor observed in MS patients could therefore originate in lesions of the brainstem (midbrain) or cerebellothalamic circuits, or may correspond to an enhanced PT, partly favored by cerebellar dysfunction and being more visible during movement execution in the absence of concomitant motor deficit.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2082524174","numberInSourceReferences":55,"doi":"10.1186/1756-0500-6-260","title":"Local dynamic stability as a responsive index for the evaluation of rehabilitation effect on fall risk in patients with multiple sclerosis: a longitudinal study","authors":[{"id":"Roger Hilfiker","orcid":null,"LN":"Hilfiker","FN":"Roger","affil":"HES-SO Valais-Wallis (CH)","name":"Roger Hilfiker"},{"id":"Claude Vaney","orcid":null,"LN":"Vaney","FN":"Claude","affil":"Berner Augenklinik am Lindenhofspital (CH)","name":"Claude Vaney"},{"id":"Brigitte Gattlen","orcid":null,"LN":"Gattlen","FN":"Brigitte","affil":"Berner Augenklinik am Lindenhofspital (CH)","name":"Brigitte Gattlen"},{"id":"André Meichtry","orcid":null,"LN":"Meichtry","FN":"André","affil":"Zurich University of Applied Sciences (CH)","name":"André Meichtry"},{"id":"Olivier Dériaz","orcid":null,"LN":"Dériaz","FN":"Olivier","affil":"Clinique Romande de Réadaptation (CH)","name":"Olivier Dériaz"},{"id":"Véronique Lugon-Moulin","orcid":null,"LN":"Lugon-Moulin","FN":"Véronique","affil":"Berner Augenklinik am Lindenhofspital (CH)","name":"Véronique Lugon-Moulin"},{"id":"Anne-Marie Anchisi-Bellwald","orcid":null,"LN":"Anchisi-Bellwald","FN":"Anne-Marie","affil":"Berner Augenklinik am Lindenhofspital (CH)","name":"Anne-Marie Anchisi-Bellwald"},{"id":"Cécilia Palaci","orcid":null,"LN":"Palaci","FN":"Cécilia","affil":"Berner Augenklinik am Lindenhofspital (CH)","name":"Cécilia Palaci"},{"id":"Denise Foinant","orcid":null,"LN":"Foinant","FN":"Denise","affil":"Berner Augenklinik am Lindenhofspital (CH)","name":"Denise Foinant"},{"id":"Philippe Terrier","orcid":null,"LN":"Terrier","FN":"Philippe","affil":"Clinique Romande de Réadaptation (CH)","name":"Philippe Terrier"}],"year":2013,"journal":"BMC Research Notes","references":["W1968043607","W1969511443","W1972955882","W1973380907","W1997421139","W1997714589","W2009627994","W2011408110","W2016923041","W2019828652","W2021470828","W2026788108","W2029880081","W2042378836","W2049244655","W2055757491","W2057688261","W2058714309","W2059079582","W2061464141","W2064936982","W2064946893","W2068667413","W2077170084","W2079692517","W2097023480","W2104615029","W2112165124","W2112370270","W2114121779","W2115797607","W2118092438","W2118234473","W2122347629","W2124428761","W2125848295","W2126724328","W2145481931","W2146300202","W2151867794","W2156527590","W2156691412","W2161899291","W2168128330","W2998063085","W3022799910"],"citationsCount":34,"abstract":"Gait and balance problems are common in patients with multiple sclerosis, leading to high risk for falls.

Physical activity has been positively associated with QOL, but little is known about the factors that explain and/or confound the relationship in those with MS. On the basis of a social‐cognitive perspective and previous research, the authors tested the hypothesis that physical activity would be indirectly associated with QOL through a mediated pathway that included self-efficacy and functional limitations, after controlling for perceived social support. Participants: Participants were 196 individuals with a definite diagnosis of MS living in the Midwest region of the United States who completed a battery of questionnaires and wore a pedometer and accelerometer for a 7-day period. Results: Covariance modeling analyses indicated that physical activity was indirectly associated with QOL through a pathway that included self-efficacy and functional limitations, and the pattern of relationships was independent of the perception of social support. Conclusions: The findings support physical activity as a possible modifiable behavior for mitigating reductions of QOL in those with MS and suggest that a social‐ cognitive model aids in the understanding of physical activity’s relationships with QOL.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3098440421","numberInSourceReferences":234,"doi":"10.1016/J.GAITPOST.2020.11.011","title":"Smartphone accelerometry to assess postural control in individuals with multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Katherine L.

Falls are a major health concern for people with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS), and impaired postural control is an important predictor of falls. Lab-based technology to measure posture is precise but expensive, and clinical tests may not capture underlying impairments. An alternative solution is to leverage smartphone accelerometry as it is affordable, ubiquitous, and portable. : Can smartphone accelerometry measure postural control compared to a force plate and research grade accelerometer in pwMS, and can smartphone accelerometry discriminate between assisted device and non-assisted device users? 27 pwMS (12 assisted device users, 15 non-assisted device users) stood on a force plate while holding a smartphone with an attached research grade accelerometer against their chest. Participants performed two, 30 s trials of: eyes open, eyes closed, semi-tandem, tandem, and single leg. Acceleration and center of pressure were extracted, and Root Mean Square (RMS) and 95 % confidence ellipse were calculated. Spearman’s correlations were performed, and receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) were calculated. There were moderate to high correlations between the smartphone and accelerometer for RMS (ρ = 0.85 – 1.0; p = 0.001 – <0.001) and 95 % area ellipse (ρ = 0.92 – 0.99; p = <0.001). There were weak to moderate correlations between the smartphone and force plate for RMS (ρ = 0.38 – 0.92; p = 0.06 – <0.001) and 95 % area ellipse (ρ = 0.69 – 0.90 p = 0.002 – <0.001). To discriminate between assisted device usage, ROC curves for smartphone outputs were constructed, the AUC was high and statistically significant (p < 0.001 – 0.02). There is potential to leverage smartphone accelerometery to measure postural control in pwMS. These finding provide preliminary results to support the development of a mobile health application to measure fall risk for pwMS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2560138040","numberInSourceReferences":122,"doi":"10.1123/JPAH.2016-0335","title":"Patterns and Predictors of Change in Moderate-to-Vigorous Physical Activity Over Time in Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Rachel E.

The recent emergence of inertial body sensors for gait assessment addresses the limitations of visual observation and subjective clinical evaluation by providing more precise and objective measures. Inertial sensors have been included in an ongoing study at the University of Virginia Medical Center on Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a chronic autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) that produces neurologic impairment and functional disability over time, with the goal of improving the ability to assess MS-affected gait and to distinguish between subjects with MS and those without MS. This work presents a gait assessment technique based on causal modeling to distinguish MS-affected gait and healthy gait. The approach in this work is based on the hypothesis that the strength of interaction between body parts during walking is greater in healthy controls that in MS subjects. The strength of interaction was quantified using a causality index based on the pairwise causal relationships between body parts as characterized by the Phase Slope Index (PSI) of inertial signals from pairs of body parts. In a pilot study with 41 subjects (28 MS subjects and 13 healthy controls), the approach developed in this paper provided better separability (p < 0.0001) compared with existing methods.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2334090054","numberInSourceReferences":39,"doi":"10.1055/S-0031-1271750","title":"Sind Mobilitätseinschränkungen bei Patienten mit Multipler Sklerose messbar?","authors":[{"id":"Sondra Schlesinger","orcid":null,"LN":"Schlesinger","FN":"Sondra","name":"Sondra Schlesinger"},{"id":"A.

This study aimed to verify the existence of possible relationships among PA parameters and the spatio-temporal parameters of gait when both are instrumentally assessed.Thirty-one pwMS (17F, 14 M, mean age 52.5, mean Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score 3.1) were requested to wear a tri-axial accelerometer 24 hours/day for 7 consecutive days and underwent an instrumental gait analysis, performed using an inertial sensor located on the low back, immediately before the PA assessment period. Main spatio-temporal parameters of gait (i.e., gait speed, stride length, cadence and duration of stance, swing, and double support phase) were extracted by processing trunk accelerations. PA was quantified using average number of daily steps and percentage of time spent at different PA intensity, the latter calculated using cut-point sets previously validated for MS. The existence of possible relationships between PA and gait parameters was assessed using Spearman rank correlation coefficient rho.Gait speed and stride length were the parameters with the highest number of significant correlations with PA features. In particular, they were found moderately to largely correlated with number of daily steps (rho 0.62, P< .001), percentage of sedentary activity (rho = -0.44, P < .001) and percentage of moderate-to-vigorous activity (rho = 0.48, P < .001). Small to moderate significant correlations were observed between PA intensity and duration of stance, swing and double support phases.The data obtained suggest that the most relevant determinants associated with higher and more intense levels of PA in free-living conditions are gait speed and stride length. The simultaneous quantitative assessment of gait parameters and PA levels might represent a useful support for physical therapists in tailoring optimized rehabilitative and training interventions.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2573019597","numberInSourceReferences":123,"doi":"10.1186/S12883-016-0783-0","title":"Subjective and objective assessment of physical activity in multiple sclerosis and their relation to health-related quality of life","authors":[{"id":"Theresa Krüger","orcid":null,"LN":"Krüger","FN":"Theresa","affil":"Charité - University Medicine Berlin (DE)","name":"Theresa Krüger"},{"id":"Janina Behrens","orcid":null,"LN":"Behrens","FN":"Janina","affil":"Charité - University Medicine Berlin (DE)","name":"Janina Behrens"},{"id":"Anuschka Grobelny","orcid":null,"LN":"Grobelny","FN":"Anuschka","affil":"Charité - University Medicine Berlin (DE)","name":"Anuschka Grobelny"},{"id":"Karen Otte","orcid":"0000-0002-3518-5274","LN":"Otte","FN":"Karen","affil":"Pathodiagnostik Berlin (DE)","name":"Karen Otte"},{"id":"Sebastian Mansow-Model","orcid":null,"LN":"Mansow-Model","FN":"Sebastian","affil":"Pathodiagnostik Berlin (DE)","name":"Sebastian Mansow-Model"},{"id":"Bastian Kayser","orcid":null,"LN":"Kayser","FN":"Bastian","affil":"Pathodiagnostik Berlin (DE)","name":"Bastian Kayser"},{"id":"Judith Bellmann-Strobl","orcid":null,"LN":"Bellmann-Strobl","FN":"Judith","affil":"Charité - University Medicine Berlin (DE)","name":"Judith Bellmann-Strobl"},{"id":"Alexander U.

We here aimed to explore two standard methods (subjective plus objective) to assess PA reduction in PwMS and to describe the relation of PA to health-related quality of life (hrQoL).PA was objectively measured over a 7-day period in 26 PwMS (EDSS 1.5-6.0) and 30 matched healthy controls (HC) using SenseWear mini® armband (SWAmini) and reported as step count, mean total and activity related energy expenditure (EE) as well as time spent in PA of different intensities. Measures of EE were also derived from self-assessment with IPAQ (International Physical Activity Questionnaire) long version, which additionally yielded information on the context of PA and a classification into subjects' PA levels. To explore the convergence between both types of assessment, IPAQ categories (low, moderate, high) were related to selected PA parameters from objective assessment using ANOVA. Group differences and associated effect sizes for all PA parameters as well as their relation to clinical and hrQoL measures were determined.Both, SWAmini and IPAQ assessment, captured differences in PA between PwMS and HC. IPAQ categories fit well with common cut-offs for step count (p = 0.002) and mean METs (p = 0.004) to determine PA levels with objective devices. Correlations between specifically matched pairs of IPAQ and SWAmini parameters ranged between r .288 and r .507. Concerning hrQoL, the lower limb mobility subscore was related to four PA measures, while a relation with patients' report of general contentment was only seen for one.Both methods of assessment seem applicable in PwMS and able to describe reductions in daily PA at group level. Whether they can be used to track individual effects of interventions to enhance PA levels needs further exploration. The relation of PA measures with hrQoL seen with lower limb mobility suggests lower limb function not only as a major target for intervention to increase PA but also as a possible surrogate for PA changes.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2965732419","numberInSourceReferences":163,"doi":"10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0220613","title":"Ecological validity of walking capacity tests following rehabilitation in people with multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Rainer Ehling","orcid":"0000-0002-6291-9659","LN":"Ehling","FN":"Rainer","affil":"Department of Neurology, Clinic for Rehabilitation Münster, Münster, Austria","name":"Rainer Ehling"},{"id":"Gabriel Bsteh","orcid":"0000-0002-0825-0851","LN":"Bsteh","FN":"Gabriel","affil":"Universität Innsbruck (AT), Innsbruck Medical University (AT)","name":"Gabriel Bsteh"},{"id":"Andreas Muehlbacher","orcid":null,"LN":"Muehlbacher","FN":"Andreas","affil":"Department of Neurology, Clinic for Rehabilitation Münster, Münster, Austria.","name":"Andreas Muehlbacher"},{"id":"Kay-Geert A.

However, the correlation was strongly dependent on pre-existing walking disability defined by EDSS and only pwMS with \"mild\" walking impairment (EDSS 2-3.5) were able to transfer benefits measurable by walking capacity tests into improved everyday life mobility, while pwMS with \"moderate to severe\" walking disability (EDSS 4-6.5) were not.Ecological validity of changes in walking capacity tests following MIR is strongly dependent on pre-existing walking impairment.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4210446197","numberInSourceReferences":268,"doi":"10.3389/FNEUR.2021.821640","title":"Walking With Horizontal Head Turns Is Impaired in Persons With Early-Stage Multiple Sclerosis Showing Normal Locomotion","authors":[{"id":"Ilaria Carpinella","orcid":"0000-0001-7486-0706","LN":"Carpinella","FN":"Ilaria","affil":"Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation (IT)","name":"Ilaria Carpinella"},{"id":"Elisa Gervasoni","orcid":null,"LN":"Gervasoni","FN":"Elisa","affil":"Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation (IT)","name":"Elisa Gervasoni"},{"id":"Denise Anastasi","orcid":null,"LN":"Anastasi","FN":"Denise","affil":"Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation (IT)","name":"Denise Anastasi"},{"id":"Rachele Di Giovanni","orcid":"0000-0003-4723-9302","LN":"Giovanni","FN":"Rachele Di","affil":"Centro Ricerche FIAT (IT)","name":"Rachele Di Giovanni"},{"id":"Andrea Tacchino","orcid":null,"LN":"Tacchino","FN":"Andrea","affil":"Associazione Italiana Sclerosi Multipla (IT)","name":"Andrea Tacchino"},{"id":"Giampaolo Brichetto","orcid":null,"LN":"Brichetto","FN":"Giampaolo","affil":"Associazione Italiana Sclerosi Multipla (IT)","name":"Giampaolo Brichetto"},{"id":"Paolo Confalonieri","orcid":null,"LN":"Confalonieri","FN":"Paolo","affil":"Istituto Neurologico Carlo Besta (IT)","name":"Paolo Confalonieri"},{"id":"Claudio Solaro","orcid":null,"LN":"Solaro","FN":"Claudio","affil":"Centro Ricerche FIAT (IT)","name":"Claudio Solaro"},{"id":"Marco Rovaris","orcid":null,"LN":"Rovaris","FN":"Marco","affil":"Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation (IT)","name":"Marco Rovaris"},{"id":"Maurizio Ferrarin","orcid":null,"LN":"Ferrarin","FN":"Maurizio","affil":"Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation (IT)","name":"Maurizio Ferrarin"},{"id":"Davide Cattaneo","orcid":null,"LN":"Cattaneo","FN":"Davide","affil":"University of Milan (IT), Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation (IT)","name":"Davide Cattaneo"}],"year":2022,"journal":"Frontiers in Neurology","references":["W1571349812","W1625126257","W1814706065","W1965886101","W1996474271","W2001818617","W2006153906","W2015309834","W2016923041","W2021470828","W2041756956","W2046987158","W2050294282","W2055522990","W2075204921","W2082524174","W2103955611","W2109588689","W2110034853","W2112165124","W2112374874","W2114121779","W2122545833","W2124180267","W2124428761","W2125948867","W2126197316","W2142577589","W2143567192","W2144376710","W2148229470","W2161634194","W2162908184","W2400259544","W2415556791","W2436092751","W2516553076","W2569745235","W2607430753","W2616685044","W2622095543","W2748897565","W2752224735","W2807809518","W2889032177","W2899738179","W2900888466","W2913189814","W2913204146","W2944200744","W2951639247","W2962864091","W2968464794","W2981782776","W2983907048","W2994708240","W2998382978","W3004440884","W3008262061","W3016463894","W3021653253","W3029517753","W3114719736","W3123867245","W3154614999","W4211048507"],"citationsCount":2,"abstract":"Turning the head while walking (an action often required during daily living) is particularly challenging to maintain balance. It can therefore potentially reveal subtle impairments in early-stage people with multiple sclerosis who still show normal locomotion (NW-PwMS). This would help in identifying those subjects who can benefit from early preventive exercise aimed at slowing the MS-related functional decline.To analyze if the assessment of walking with horizontal head turns (WHHT) through inertial sensors can discriminate between healthy subjects (HS) and NW-PwMS and between NW-PwMS subgroups. To assess if the discriminant ability of the instrumented WHHT is higher compared to clinical scores. To assess the concurrent validity of the sensor-based metrics.In this multicenter study, 40 HS and 59 NW-PwMS [Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) ≤ 2.5, disease duration ≤ 5 years] were tested. Participants executed Item-6 of the Fullerton Advanced Balance scale-short (FAB-s) wearing three inertial sensors on the trunk and ankles. The item required to horizontally turn the head at a beat of the metronome (100 bpm) while walking. Signals of the sensors were processed to compute spatiotemporal, regularity, symmetry, dynamic stability, and trunk sway metrics descriptive of WHHT.Mediolateral regularity, anteroposterior symmetry, and mediolateral stability were reduced in NW-PwMS vs. HS (p ≤ 0.001), and showed moderate discriminant ability (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve [AUC]: 0.71-0.73). AP symmetry and ML stability were reduced (p ≤ 0.026) in EDSS: 2-2.5 vs. EDSS: 0-1.5 subgroup (AUC: 0.69-0.70). The number of NW-PwMS showing at least one abnormal instrumented metric (68%) was larger (p ≤ 0.002) than the number of participants showing abnormal FAB-s-Item6 (32%) and FAB-s clinical scores (39%). EDSS: 2-2.5 subgroup included more individuals showing abnormal instrumented metrics (86%) compared to EDSS: 0-1.5 subgroup (57%). The instrumented metrics significantly correlated with FAB-s-Item6 and FAB-s scores (|Spearman's rs | ≥ 0.37, p < 0.001), thus demonstrating their concurrent validity.The instrumented assessment of WHHT provided valid objective metrics that discriminated, with higher sensitivity than clinical scores, between HS and NW-PwMS and between EDSS subgroups. The method is a promising tool to complement clinical evaluation, and reveal subclinical impairments in persons who can benefit from early preventive rehabilitative interventions.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3181030379","numberInSourceReferences":226,"doi":"10.1038/S41598-021-92776-X","title":"Interpretable deep learning for the remote characterisation of ambulation in multiple sclerosis using smartphones","authors":[{"id":"Andrew P.

Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) may capture a richer representation of healthy and MS-related ambulatory characteristics from the raw smartphone-based inertial sensor data than standard feature-based methodologies. To overcome the typical limitations associated with remotely generated health data, such as low subject numbers, sparsity, and heterogeneous data, a transfer learning (TL) model from similar large open-source datasets was proposed. Our TL framework leveraged the ambulatory information learned on human activity recognition (HAR) tasks collected from wearable smartphone sensor data. It was demonstrated that fine-tuning TL DCNN HAR models towards MS disease recognition tasks outperformed previous Support Vector Machine (SVM) feature-based methods, as well as DCNN models trained end-to-end, by upwards of 8-15%. A lack of transparency of \"black-box\" deep networks remains one of the largest stumbling blocks to the wider acceptance of deep learning for clinical applications. Ensuing work therefore aimed to visualise DCNN decisions attributed by relevance heatmaps using Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Through the LRP framework, the patterns captured from smartphone-based inertial sensor data that were reflective of those who are healthy versus people with MS (PwMS) could begin to be established and understood. Interpretations suggested that cadence-based measures, gait speed, and ambulation-related signal perturbations were distinct characteristics that distinguished MS disability from healthy participants. Robust and interpretable outcomes, generated from high-frequency out-of-clinic assessments, could greatly augment the current in-clinic assessment picture for PwMS, to inform better disease management techniques, and enable the development of better therapeutic interventions.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3106819768","numberInSourceReferences":190,"doi":"10.3390/IJERPH17239044","title":"The Two-Minute Walk Test in Persons with Multiple Sclerosis: Correlations of Cadence with Free-Living Walking Do Not Support Ecological Validity","authors":[{"id":"Viktoria Karle","orcid":null,"LN":"Karle","FN":"Viktoria","affil":"University of Regensburg (DE), University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (DE)","name":"Viktoria Karle"},{"id":"Verena Hartung","orcid":null,"LN":"Hartung","FN":"Verena","affil":"University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (DE)","name":"Verena Hartung"},{"id":"Katerina Ivanovska","orcid":null,"LN":"Ivanovska","FN":"Katerina","affil":"University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (DE)","name":"Katerina Ivanovska"},{"id":"Mathias Mäurer","orcid":null,"LN":"Mäurer","FN":"Mathias","affil":"Klinikum Würzburg Mitte (DE)","name":"Mathias Mäurer"},{"id":"Peter Flachenecker","orcid":null,"LN":"Flachenecker","FN":"Peter","affil":"Neurologisches Rehabilitationszentrum Quellenhof Bad Wildbad (DE)","name":"Peter Flachenecker"},{"id":"Klaus Pfeifer","orcid":null,"LN":"Pfeifer","FN":"Klaus","affil":"University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (DE)","name":"Klaus Pfeifer"},{"id":"A.

However, functional mobility observed in supervised settings may not reflect daily life which may impact assessments of fall risk and impairment in the clinic. To investigate this further, we compared the utility of sensor-based performance metrics from sit-stand transitions during daily life and a structured task to inform fall risk and impairment in PwMS. Thirty-seven PwMS instrumented with wearable sensors (thigh and chest) completed supervised 30-second chair stand tests (30CST) and underwent two days of instrumented daily life monitoring. Performance metrics were computed for sit-stand transitions during daily life and 30CSTs. EDSS sub scores and fall history were used to dichotomize participants into groups: pyramidal/no pyramidal impairment, sensory/no sensory impairment and high/low fall risk. The ability of performance metrics to discriminate between groups was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC). The feature that best discriminated between high and low fall risk was a chest acceleration measurement from the supervised instrumented 30CST (AUC = 0.89). Only chest features indicated sensory impairment, however the task was different between supervised and daily life. The metric that best discriminated pyramidal impairment was a chest-derived feature (AUC = 0.89) from supervised 30CSTs. The highest AUC from daily life was observed in faller classification with the average sit-stand time (0.81). While characterizing sit-stand performance during daily life may yield insights into fall risk and may be performed without a clinic visit, there remains value to conducting supervised functional assessments to provide the best classification performance between the investigated impairments in this sample.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2955805380","numberInSourceReferences":171,"doi":"10.1080/09638288.2019.1634768","title":"Physical activity is associated with neuromuscular and physical function in patients with multiple sclerosis independent of disease severity","authors":[{"id":"Scott Rooney","orcid":null,"LN":"Rooney","FN":"Scott","affil":"Glasgow Caledonian University (GB)","name":"Scott Rooney"},{"id":"Morten Riemenschneider","orcid":null,"LN":"Riemenschneider","FN":"Morten","affil":"Aarhus University (DK)","name":"Morten Riemenschneider"},{"id":"Ulrik Dalgas","orcid":"0000-0003-4132-2789","LN":"Dalgas","FN":"Ulrik","affil":"Aarhus University (DK)","name":"Ulrik Dalgas"},{"id":"Marie-Louise Jørgensen","orcid":null,"LN":"Jørgensen","FN":"Marie-Louise","affil":"Aarhus University (DK)","name":"Marie-Louise Jørgensen"},{"id":"Anne-Sophie Michelsen","orcid":null,"LN":"Michelsen","FN":"Anne-Sophie","affil":"Aarhus University (DK)","name":"Anne-Sophie Michelsen"},{"id":"Jan Christian Brønd","orcid":null,"LN":"Brønd","FN":"Jan Christian","affil":"University of Southern Denmark (DK)","name":"Jan Christian Brønd"},{"id":"Lars G.

People living with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience impairments in gait and mobility, that are not fully captured with manually timed walking tests or rating scales administered during periodic clinical visits. We have developed a smartphone-based assessment of ambulation performance, the 5 U-Turn Test (5UTT), a quantitative self-administered test of U-turn ability while walking, for people with MS (PwMS). What is the test-retest reliability and concurrent validity of U-turn speed, an unsupervised self-assessment of gait and balance impairment, measured using a body-worn smartphone during the 5UTT? 76 PwMS and 25 healthy controls (HCs) participated in a cross-sectional non-randomised interventional feasibility study. The 5UTT was self-administered daily and the median U-turn speed, measured during a 14-day session, was compared against existing validated in-clinic measures of MS-related disability. U-turn speed, measured during a 14-day session from the 5UTT, demonstrated good-to-excellent test-retest reliability in PwMS alone and combined with HCs (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.87 [95 % CI: 0.80–0.92]) and moderate-to-excellent reliability in HCs alone (ICC = 0.88 [95 % CI: 0.69–0.96]). U-turn speed was significantly correlated with in-clinic measures of walking speed, physical fatigue, ambulation impairment, overall MS-related disability and patients’ self-perception of quality of life, at baseline, Week 12 and Week 24. The minimal detectable change of the U-turn speed from the 5UTT was low (19.42 %) in PwMS and indicates a good precision of this measurement tool when compared with conventional in-clinic measures of walking performance. The frequent self-assessment of turn speed, as an outcome measure from a smartphone-based U-turn test, may represent an ecologically valid digital solution to remotely and reliably monitor gait and balance impairment in a home environment during MS clinical trials and practice.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2804213301","numberInSourceReferences":137,"doi":"10.1159/000488040","title":"Free-Living Physical Activity Monitoring in Adult US Patients with Multiple Sclerosis Using a Consumer Wearable Device","authors":[{"id":"Pronabesh DasMahapatra","orcid":null,"LN":"DasMahapatra","FN":"Pronabesh","affil":"PatientsLikeMe (US)","name":"Pronabesh DasMahapatra"},{"id":"Emil Chiauzzi","orcid":"0000-0003-4995-7308","LN":"Chiauzzi","FN":"Emil","affil":"PatientsLikeMe (US)","name":"Emil Chiauzzi"},{"id":"Rishi Bhalerao","orcid":null,"LN":"Bhalerao","FN":"Rishi","affil":"PatientsLikeMe (US)","name":"Rishi Bhalerao"},{"id":"Jane Rhodes","orcid":null,"LN":"Rhodes","FN":"Jane","affil":"Biogen (US)","name":"Jane Rhodes"}],"year":2018,"journal":"Digital biomarkers","references":["W202405008","W1966810109","W2014133991","W2014725775","W2033900397","W2073743819","W2082956218","W2089653770","W2092276594","W2095310389","W2098217376","W2107197659","W2112413713","W2114060341","W2128621051","W2130834933","W2132896775","W2134206494","W2135808037","W2151621222","W2152062081","W2154568934","W2220182234","W2266982813","W2342870422","W2371432680","W2395956106","W2557274736","W2587391403","W2588852707","W2737981193","W2764034922","W2764204146","W2770689260","W2776467836"],"citationsCount":17,"abstract":"&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Introduction:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Wearable devices have been used to characterize physical activity in multiple sclerosis (MS). The objectives of this study were to advance the literature on the utility of free-living physical activity tracking from secondary analyses of a pilot study in MS patients. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Method:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The original observational study was conducted in participants with MS at PatientsLikeMe (www.PatientsLikeMe.com), an online network of patients with chronic diseases. Participants completed a baseline self-assessment, and received a Fitbit One&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; wearable device with instructions to upload data. Eligible participants (1) self-reported MS, (2) logged on to the PatientsLikeMe website 90 days prior to enrollment, and (3) consented to participate electronically. Participants (1) &amp;#x3c; 18 years, (2) living outside the United States, and (3) requiring wheelchair assistance for most daily activities were excluded. The secondary analyses were limited to participants with complete data on MS type, disease duration, and Multiple Sclerosis Rating Scale (MSRS) and at least 7 days of wearable data. Step count was used as a measure of physical activity. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The analysis cohort of 114 participants uploaded a mean of 20.1 days of wearable data over the 23-day study (87% adherence); participants averaged 4,393 steps per day. The mean age of participants was 52 years, predominantly female (75%), relapsing-remitting type (79%), with mean disease duration of 16 years. Mean MSRS score within 30-day of baseline was 32; 72% reported mild-moderate walking disability. The reliability of step count measured by intraclass correlation was 0.55 for a single day, ≥0.7 for 2-day average, and ≥0.9 for 7-day average. After controlling for covariates, self-reported disease severity (MSRS quartile) was an independent predictor of step count (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;#x3c; 0.001). Least square means (LS means) for participants that were least disabled (lowest quartile) was 5,937 steps, which was significantly higher than participants in the second, third, and fourth quartiles (4,570, 3,490, and 3,272, respectively). Similarly, LS means of participants with no ambulatory disability (measured by MSRS walk component) was 6,931 steps, significantly higher than participants with greater disability (4,743, 4,394, 2,727 steps for symptomatic, mild, and moderate disability, respectively, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;#x3c; 0.001). &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Discussion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Using an interactive platform, this study captured free-living mobility data in MS patients. Important metrics such as the use of a minimum of 2-day estimates and self-reported disability were found to be robust indicators and correlates, respectively, of participant activity levels. Further triangulation of such metrics may reduce the burden on patients, clinicians, and researchers when monitoring clinical status.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W267858762","numberInSourceReferences":98,"doi":"10.1007/S00415-015-7764-X","title":"Walking function in clinical monitoring of multiple sclerosis by telemedicine","authors":[{"id":"Nuria Sola-Valls","orcid":null,"LN":"Sola-Valls","FN":"Nuria","affil":"University of Barcelona (ES)","name":"Nuria Sola-Valls"},{"id":"Yolanda Blanco","orcid":null,"LN":"Blanco","FN":"Yolanda","affil":"University of Barcelona (ES)","name":"Yolanda Blanco"},{"id":"Maria S.

Yet fall prevention interventions are not often prescribed until after a fall has been reported to a healthcare provider. While still nascent, objective fall risk assessments could help in prescribing preventative interventions. To this end, retrospective fall status classification commonly serves as an intermediate step in developing prospective fall risk assessments. Previous research has identified measures of gait biomechanics that differ between PwMS who have fallen and those who have not, but these biomechanical indices have not yet been leveraged to detect PwMS who have fallen. Moreover, they require the use of laboratory-based measurement technologies, which prevent clinical deployment. Here we demonstrate that a bidirectional long short-term (BiLSTM) memory deep neural network was able to identify PwMS who have recently fallen with good performance (AUC of 0.88) based on accelerometer data recorded from two wearable sensors during a one-minute walking task. These results provide substantial improvements over machine learning models trained on spatiotemporal gait parameters (21% improvement in AUC), statistical features from the wearable sensor data (16%), and patient-reported (19%) and neurologist-administered (24%) measures in this sample. The success and simplicity (two wearable sensors, only one-minute of walking) of this approach indicates the promise of inexpensive wearable sensors for capturing fall risk in PwMS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3135207484","numberInSourceReferences":213,"doi":"10.3390/JCM10061160","title":"Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis Disability Progression Using a Wearable Biosensor: A Pilot Study","authors":[{"id":"Simona Bonavita","orcid":"0000-0002-8561-9720","LN":"Bonavita","FN":"Simona","affil":"University of Campania \"Luigi Vanvitelli\" (IT)","name":"Simona Bonavita"},{"id":"Giuseppina Miele","orcid":null,"LN":"Miele","FN":"Giuseppina","affil":"University of Campania \"Luigi Vanvitelli\" (IT)","name":"Giuseppina Miele"},{"id":"Alfredo Mignone","orcid":null,"LN":"Mignone","FN":"Alfredo","affil":"University of Campania \"Luigi Vanvitelli\" (IT)","name":"Alfredo Mignone"},{"id":"Elisabetta Signoriello","orcid":"0000-0001-5753-6752","LN":"Signoriello","FN":"Elisabetta","affil":"University of Campania \"Luigi Vanvitelli\" (IT)","name":"Elisabetta Signoriello"},{"id":"Giacomo Lus","orcid":null,"LN":"Lus","FN":"Giacomo","affil":"University of Campania \"Luigi Vanvitelli\" (IT)","name":"Giacomo Lus"},{"id":"Marinella Clerico","orcid":null,"LN":"Clerico","FN":"Marinella","affil":"University of Turin (IT)","name":"Marinella Clerico"},{"id":"Maddalena Sparaco","orcid":null,"LN":"Sparaco","FN":"Maddalena","affil":"University of Campania \"Luigi Vanvitelli\" (IT)","name":"Maddalena Sparaco"}],"year":2021,"journal":"Journal of Clinical Medicine","references":["W267858762","W1991209103","W2007757525","W2014725775","W2065262862","W2068207795","W2092276594","W2112165124","W2112413713","W2118267528","W2159230394","W2169482678","W2231489206","W2273145274","W2321149532","W2557274736","W2565317782","W2622915959","W2765429604","W2949728895","W3011366954","W3022677609"],"citationsCount":16,"abstract":"Background: The evaluation of walking activity of people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) is desirable.

We assessed disability with the expanded disability status scale, two-minute walking test (2MWT), timed 25-foot walk test (T25FWT), and nine-hole peg test. We collected PROs measuring fatigue, ambulatory ability, depression, quality of life, and bladder/bowel function. Participants were asked to wear the accelerometer for a period of 30 days. Results: The Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient showed a moderate negative correlation between the patient-determined disease steps (PDDS) score with the mean steps/day, a strong negative correlation between the PDDS score with the maximum number of daily steps (MNDS) and a moderate negative correlation between the fatigue severity scale score and MNDS. A moderate negative correlation between MNDS and the 2MWT and a moderate negative correlation between MNDS and the T25FW was found. Conclusion: Our results suggest that motor parameters derived from the accelerometer could be a reliable measure of motor disability in pwMS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3159109236","numberInSourceReferences":220,"doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2021.3076707","title":"Toward a Remote Assessment of Walking Bout and Speed: Application in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Arash Atrsaei","orcid":null,"LN":"Atrsaei","FN":"Arash","affil":"École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (CH)","name":"Arash Atrsaei"},{"id":"Farzin Dadashi","orcid":"0000-0003-3662-6323","LN":"Dadashi","FN":"Farzin","affil":"Gait Up S.A., Lausanne, Switzerland","name":"Farzin Dadashi"},{"id":"Benoit Mariani","orcid":null,"LN":"Mariani","FN":"Benoit","affil":"Gait Up S.A., Lausanne, Switzerland","name":"Benoit Mariani"},{"id":"Roman Gonzenbach","orcid":null,"LN":"Gonzenbach","FN":"Roman","affil":"Valens Clinics (CH)","name":"Roman Gonzenbach"},{"id":"Kamiar Aminian","orcid":null,"LN":"Aminian","FN":"Kamiar","affil":"École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (CH)","name":"Kamiar Aminian"}],"year":2021,"journal":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","references":["W16535422","W211115071","W1840528038","W1911839968","W1975472379","W1981740502","W1990913275","W1992762558","W2000468033","W2008532656","W2013337604","W2016083194","W2016823365","W2033900397","W2035541251","W2038950641","W2047329245","W2058190976","W2067428313","W2069981462","W2082124972","W2083539525","W2098949123","W2105382574","W2107625176","W2112165124","W2122365325","W2127367027","W2128393901","W2132279149","W2138640940","W2142221837","W2151621222","W2153542846","W2154772567","W2155952367","W2157118255","W2159080973","W2160146756","W2161634194","W2170931123","W2531952511","W2535510583","W2547157569","W2566036777","W2586302922","W2588332456","W2620639087","W2752492856","W2777074421","W2794934809","W2801415007","W2883576155","W2905560890","W2936082441","W2944134122","W2968464794","W2970261303","W2996986337","W3006252679","W3007842937","W3021823648","W3031457119","W3033779083","W3085935853","W3092569475","W3134641921"],"citationsCount":7,"abstract":"Gait speed as a powerful biomarker of mobility is mostly assessed in controlled environments, e.g. in the clinic. With wearable inertial sensors, gait speed can be estimated in an objective manner. However, most of the previous works have validated the gait speed estimation algorithms in clinical settings which can be different than the home assessments in which the patients demonstrate their actual performance. Moreover, to provide comfort for the users, devising an algorithm based on a single sensor setup is essential. To this end, the goal of this study was to develop and validate a new gait speed estimation method based on a machine learning approach to predict gait speed in both clinical and home assessments by a sensor on the lower back. Moreover, two methods were introduced to detect walking bouts during daily activities at home. We have validated the algorithms in 35 patients with multiple sclerosis as it often presents with mobility difficulties. Therefore, the robustness of the algorithm can be shown in an impaired or slow gait. Against silver standard multi-sensor references, we achieved a bias close to zero and a precision of 0.15 m/s for gait speed estimation. Furthermore, the proposed machine learning-based locomotion detection method had a median of 96.8% specificity, 93.0% sensitivity, 96.4% accuracy, and 78.6% F1-score in detecting walking bouts at home. The high performance of the proposed algorithm showed the feasibility of the unsupervised mobility assessment introduced in this study.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3036514278","numberInSourceReferences":189,"doi":"10.7224/1537-2073.2019-047","title":"Clinically Assessed Walking Capacity Versus Real-World Walking Performance in People with Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Kedar S.

Mean number of steps, mean number of steps at a brisk cadence or faster, and cumulative time per week spent walking at a brisk cadence or faster were regressed on 6MWT categories using quantile (median) regression. Contiguous steps were grouped into bouts of less than 5 minutes and 5 minutes or longer, and number of bouts 5 minutes or longer was regressed on 6MWT categories using a zero-inflated Poisson model.A total of 869 patient-days of accelerometer data were available. Mean total number of steps per day was greater for people with higher walking capacity (6MWT distance, ≥600 m). However, this group spent a small proportion of time walking at higher cadence bands. Compared with people with 6MWT distance of at least 600 m, people walking less than 500 m had approximately half the rate of walking bouts of 5 minutes or longer.

Older adults with MS undergo declines in function, and aging with MS may compromise one's perception of confidence for managing this disease and its manifestations. This cross-sectional study examined the associations between self-efficacy and physical and cognitive function in older (≥ 60 years) adults with MS. Methods: The sample included 40 older adults with MS who completed the Multiple Sclerosis Self-efficacy (MSSE) Scale, undertook measures of physical and cognitive function, and wore an accelerometer for 7 days. The data were analyzed using partial Spearman correlations and linear regression. Results: Correlation analyses indicated that function, but not control, subscale scores on the MSSE Scale correlated with all measures of physical, but not cognitive, function. Linear regression analyses indicated that the function subscale of the MSSE Scale was the only variable that consistently explained variance in physical function outcomes. Conclusions: The findings are novel evidence of the association between self-efficacy for function and physical function outcomes in older adults with MS. Future research on self-efficacy is warranted with the goal of improving physical function in older adults with MS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4213123043","numberInSourceReferences":262,"doi":"10.1007/S00415-022-10998-Z","title":"Sensor-based gait analyses of the six-minute walk test identify qualitative improvement in gait parameters of people with multiple sclerosis after rehabilitation","authors":[{"id":"Pål Berg-Hansen","orcid":"0000-0003-0925-8879","LN":"Berg-Hansen","FN":"Pål","affil":"Oslo University Hospital (NO)","name":"Pål Berg-Hansen"},{"id":"Stine Marit Moen","orcid":null,"LN":"Moen","FN":"Stine Marit","affil":"MS Center Hakadal, Hakadal, Norway.","name":"Stine Marit Moen"},{"id":"Andreas Austeng","orcid":"0000-0001-9465-8337","LN":"Austeng","FN":"Andreas","affil":"University of Oslo (NO)","name":"Andreas Austeng"},{"id":"Victor Gonzales","orcid":null,"LN":"Gonzales","FN":"Victor","affil":"SINTEF (NO)","name":"Victor Gonzales"},{"id":"Thomas Dahl Klyve","orcid":null,"LN":"Klyve","FN":"Thomas Dahl","affil":"MS Center Hakadal, Hakadal, Norway.","name":"Thomas Dahl Klyve"},{"id":"Henrik Negård","orcid":null,"LN":"Negård","FN":"Henrik","affil":"MS Center Hakadal, Hakadal, Norway.","name":"Henrik Negård"},{"id":"Trine M.

Forty-six pwMS and 20 healthy controls (HC) were included in the study. They performed the 6MWT with two inertial measurement units (IMUs) placed on the feet. Thirty-two of the pwMS were retested at the end of the stay. PwMS were divided in a mild-disability and a moderate-disability group. The 6MWT was divided in six sections of 1 min each for technical analysis, and linear mixed models were used for statistical analyses. The comparison between the two disability groups and HC highlighted significant differences for each gait parameter (all p < 0.001). The crossing effect between the test-retest and the two disability groups showed greater improvement for the moderate-disability group. Finally, the gait parameter with the higher effect size, allowing the best differentiation between the disability groups, was the foot flat ratio (R2 = 0.53). Gait analyses from wearable sensors identified different evolutions of gait patterns during the 6MWT in pwMS with different physical disability. The measured effect of a short-time rehabilitation on gait with 6MWT was higher for pwMS with higher degree of disability. Using IMUs in a clinical setting allowed to identify significant changes in inter-stride gait patterns. Wearable sensors and key parameters have the potential as useful clinical tools for focusing on gait in pwMS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3168643201","numberInSourceReferences":215,"doi":"10.1177/02692155211024135","title":"Objectively-assessed physical activity and self-reported activity pacing in adults with multiple sclerosis: A pilot study","authors":[{"id":"Ulric S.

Additionally, indirect evidence supports the notion that some mobility impaired populations demonstrate similar mobility deficits. Thus, the current study aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of three distinct aspects of mobility (walking, turning, and balance) to determine which variables were significantly different and were also able to discriminate between neurotypical older adults (OA) and middle-aged people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), and between middle-aged neurotypical adults and PwMS. Methods This study recruited 21 neurotypical OA, 19 middle-aged neurotypical adults, and 30 people with relapsing remitting MS. Participants came into the laboratory on two separate occasions to complete mobility testing while wearing wireless inertial sensors. Testing included a self-selected pace two-minute walk, a series of 180˚ and 360˚ turns, and a clinical balance test capturing a total of 99 distinct mobility characteristics. We determined significant differences for gait and turning measures through univariate analyses and a series of repeated measures analysis of variance in determining significance for balance conditions and measures. In determining discrimination between groups, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) was calculated for all individual mobility measures with a threshold of 0.80, denoting excellent discrimination. Additionally, a stepwise regression of the top five AUC producing variables was performed to determine whether a combination of variables could enhance discrimination while accounting for multicollinearity. Results The results between neurotypical OA and middle-aged PwMS demonstrated significant differences for three gait and one turning variable, with no variable or combination of variables able to provide excellent discrimination between groups. Between middle-age neurotypical adults and PwMS a variety of mean and variability gait measures demonstrated significant differences between groups; however, no variable or combination of variables met discriminatory threshold. For turning, five 360˚ turn variables demonstrated significant differences and furthermore, the combination of 360˚ mean turn duration and variability of peak turn velocity were able to discriminate between groups. Finally, the majority of postural sway measures demonstrated significant group differences and the ability to discriminate between groups, particularly during more challenging balance conditions where participants stood on a compliant surface. Conclusion These results offer a comprehensive analysis of mobility differences and measures capable of discriminating between middle-age neurotypical adults and PwMS. Additionally, these results provide evidence that OA and middle-age PwMS display similar movement characteristics and thus a potential indicator of advanced aging from a mobility perspective.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3203173550","numberInSourceReferences":298,"doi":"10.1177/13524585211048397","title":"Cardiorespiratory fitness and free-living physical activity are not associated with cognition in persons with progressive multiple sclerosis: Baseline analyses from the CogEx study","authors":[{"id":"Brian M.

However, there is limited evidence that levels of physical activity and fitness are associated with cognition in progressive MS. Objective: We examined associations among cardiorespiratory fitness, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and cognitive performance in a large, international progressive MS sample. Methods: Two hundred forty European and North American persons with progressive MS underwent cardiorespiratory fitness measurement on a recumbent stepper, wore an ActiGraph GT3X + accelerometer for 7 days for measuring MVPA, and underwent the Brief International Cognitive Assessment in MS. Results: Cardiorespiratory fitness was not significantly correlated with Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT; r = −0.01; r = −0.04), California Verbal Learning Test-II (CVLT-II; r = 0.05; r = 0.05), or Brief Visuospatial Memory Test–Revised (BVMT-R; r = −0.14; r = −0.14) z-scores controlling for age, sex, and education. MVPA and SDMT ( r = 0.05), CVLT-II ( r = −0.07), and BVMT-R ( r = 0.01) z-scores were not significantly correlated. Conclusion: Cardiorespiratory fitness and MVPA were not associated with cognition in this large progressive MS sample, yet these outcomes represent critical manipulation checks for documenting the success of the CogEx trial. This highlights the importance of examining other exercise-related mechanisms-of-action for improving cognition in progressive MS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2998902484","numberInSourceReferences":195,"doi":"10.1080/2331205X.2020.1713280","title":"Daily activity and functional performance in people with chronic disease: A cross-sectional study","authors":[{"id":"Erhard Trillingsgaard Næss-Schmidt","orcid":null,"LN":"Næss-Schmidt","FN":"Erhard Trillingsgaard","affil":"Aarhus University (DK)","name":"Erhard Trillingsgaard Næss-Schmidt"},{"id":"Asger Roer Pedersen","orcid":null,"LN":"Pedersen","FN":"Asger Roer","affil":"Aarhus University (DK)","name":"Asger Roer Pedersen"},{"id":"David Høyrup Christiansen","orcid":null,"LN":"Christiansen","FN":"David Høyrup","affil":"Aarhus University (DK)","name":"David Høyrup Christiansen"},{"id":"Nils-Bo de Vos Andersen","orcid":null,"LN":"Andersen","FN":"Nils-Bo de Vos","affil":"Primary Health Care (QA)","name":"Nils-Bo de Vos Andersen"},{"id":"John Brincks","orcid":"0000-0002-8788-1669","LN":"Brincks","FN":"John","affil":"VIA University College (DK)","name":"John Brincks"},{"id":"Bernd Grimm","orcid":null,"LN":"Grimm","FN":"Bernd","affil":"Luxembourg Institute of Research in Orthopaedics, Sports Medicine and Science (LIROMS)","name":"Bernd Grimm"},{"id":"Jørgen Feldbæk Nielsen","orcid":null,"LN":"Nielsen","FN":"Jørgen Feldbæk","affil":"Aarhus University (DK)","name":"Jørgen Feldbæk Nielsen"},{"id":"Inger Mechlenburg","orcid":"0000-0001-5432-8691","LN":"Mechlenburg","FN":"Inger","affil":"Aarhus University (DK)","name":"Inger Mechlenburg"}],"year":2020,"journal":"Cogent Medicine","references":["W1974704788","W1975030808","W1991576820","W2016931264","W2071298586","W2082956218","W2094884006","W2114629409","W2124068839","W2148930341","W2169482678","W2466676672","W2500956448","W2523355210","W2593551233","W2594023583","W2765254897","W2795821640","W2803594953","W2886702575","W2911295944","W2913022263","W2969689664"],"citationsCount":3,"abstract":"The aim of this study was to describe the physical activity profiles, in patients with stroke, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis and to investigate the association be...","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3111349481","numberInSourceReferences":207,"doi":"10.1177/2055217320975185","title":"Physical activity monitoring to assess disability progression in multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Charlotte E Stuart","orcid":null,"LN":"Stuart","FN":"Charlotte E","affil":"University of Southampton (GB)","name":"Charlotte E Stuart"},{"id":"Aravinthan Varatharaj","orcid":"0000-0003-1629-5774","LN":"Varatharaj","FN":"Aravinthan","affil":"University of Southampton (GB), University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust (GB)","name":"Aravinthan Varatharaj"},{"id":"Janine Domjan","orcid":null,"LN":"Domjan","FN":"Janine","affil":"University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust (GB)","name":"Janine Domjan"},{"id":"Sheaba Philip","orcid":null,"LN":"Philip","FN":"Sheaba","affil":"University of Southampton (GB)","name":"Sheaba Philip"},{"id":"Ian Galea","orcid":null,"LN":"Galea","FN":"Ian","affil":"University of Southampton (GB), University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust (GB)","name":"Ian Galea"}],"year":2020,"journal":"Multiple sclerosis journal, experimental, translational and clinical","references":["W1969946868","W1999532124","W2006096283","W2028942474","W2067495470","W2071988641","W2087402617","W2101080196","W2101940364","W2112165124","W2112802342","W2122545833","W2126737632","W2135361930","W2140679422","W2142577589","W2150378783","W2151529161","W2151576334","W2169482678","W2294646526","W2342870422","W2557274736","W2587391403","W2597669633","W2716827817","W2737966001","W2790022230","W2795761008","W2802618918","W2888771238","W2921754847"],"citationsCount":7,"abstract":"Clinical outcome measurement in multiple sclerosis (MS) usually requires a physical visit.

Annualized brain atrophy was measured using SIENA.RAM was tolerated well by people with MS; the device was worn 99.4% of the time.

Walking speed, as measured by a number of clinician-administered walking tests, is the primary measure of gait impairment used by clinical researchers, but inertial gait features from body-worn sensors have been proven to add clinical value. This paper seeks to understand and differentiate the physiological significance of four such features with proven value in MS to facilitate adoption by clinical researchers and incorporation in gait monitoring and analysis systems. In addition, this information can be used to select features that might be appropriate in other forms of disability. Two of the four features are computed using the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm: The \"DTW Score\" is based on the usual DTW distance, and the \"Warp Score\" is based on the warping length. The third feature, based on kernel density estimation (KDE), is the \"KDE Peak\" value. Finally, the \"Causality Index\" is based on the phase slope index between inertial signals from different body parts. Relationships between these measures and the aforementioned gait-related symptoms are determined by applying factor analysis to three common, clinical walking outcomes, then correlating the inertial measures as well as walking speed to each extracted factor. Statistically significant differences in correlation coefficients to the three extracted clinical factors support their distinct physiological meaning and suggest they may have complimentary roles in the analysis of MS-related walking disability.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2477359521","numberInSourceReferences":111,"doi":"10.1016/J.JNS.2016.07.051","title":"Fampridine and real-life walking in multiple sclerosis: Low predictive value of clinical test for habitual short-term changes","authors":[{"id":"Jan-Patrick Stellmann","orcid":null,"LN":"Stellmann","FN":"Jan-Patrick","affil":"Institute of Neuroimmunology and MS (INIMS), University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany","name":"Jan-Patrick Stellmann"},{"id":"M.

The CG participants received no training and used their own wheelchairs at home during this time.All subjects were assessed at baseline and 3 months later for fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale), upper extremity strength (digital handheld dynamometer), and propulsion technique (on a treadmill [0.5m/s] with instrumented wheels). Two 1-week bouts of physical activity were measured in both groups from home with wrist-worn accelerometry at the beginning (IG and CG in own wheelchairs) and end (IG in study wheelchair, CG in own) of the 3-month period of home use.The intervention was well tolerated, and no adverse events were reported. The IG demonstrated increased strength (P=.008) and a trend toward less fatigue (P=.068), both with large effect sizes (d>0.8), as well as reduced application of braking torque during propulsion (P=.003) with a moderate/large effect size (d=.73), compared with the CG.Findings suggest a 3-month physical activity intervention based on manual wheelchair propulsion and training is safe and feasible for some wheelchair users living with MS and may produce secondary benefits in strength, fatigue, and propulsion technique.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2016726780","numberInSourceReferences":54,"doi":"10.1007/S13760-013-0187-5","title":"Correlation analysis of visual analogue scale and measures of walking ability in multiple sclerosis patients","authors":[{"id":"Petar Filipović Grčić","orcid":null,"LN":"Grčić","FN":"Petar Filipović","affil":"University of Split (HR)","name":"Petar Filipović Grčić"},{"id":"Meri Matijaca","orcid":null,"LN":"Matijaca","FN":"Meri","affil":"University of Split (HR)","name":"Meri Matijaca"},{"id":"Ivana Bilic","orcid":null,"LN":"Bilic","FN":"Ivana","affil":"University of Split (HR)","name":"Ivana Bilic"},{"id":"Gordan Džamonja","orcid":null,"LN":"Džamonja","FN":"Gordan","affil":"University of Split (HR)","name":"Gordan Džamonja"},{"id":"Ivo Lušić","orcid":null,"LN":"Lušić","FN":"Ivo","affil":"University of Split (HR)","name":"Ivo Lušić"},{"id":"Krešimir Čaljkušić","orcid":null,"LN":"Čaljkušić","FN":"Krešimir","affil":"University of Split (HR)","name":"Krešimir Čaljkušić"},{"id":"Vesna Čapkun","orcid":null,"LN":"Čapkun","FN":"Vesna","affil":"University of Split (HR)","name":"Vesna Čapkun"}],"year":2013,"journal":"Acta Neurologica Belgica","references":["W1964580207","W1975089669","W1975255604","W2006331513","W2013753927","W2021849684","W2023990821","W2036272035","W2047339729","W2057289149","W2066858700","W2067801943","W2068531129","W2071298586","W2071821958","W2075298115","W2078052603","W2081383488","W2092380003","W2095310389","W2095314460","W2098217376","W2104878804","W2105490558","W2112165124","W2114060341","W2120263268","W2126737632","W2127449538","W2130181098","W2136915299","W2141062585","W2143567192","W2145481931","W2157761000","W2162367176","W4248115152"],"citationsCount":7,"isRetracted":false},{"id":"W1977768965","numberInSourceReferences":19,"doi":"10.1037/A0015770","title":"Longitudinal analysis of physical activity and symptoms as predictors of change in functional limitations and disability in multiple sclerosis.","authors":[{"id":"Robert W.

This paper evaluates a novel approach to (1) determine the effects of the length of the walking task on the reliability of calculated measures and (2) identify digital biomarkers for gait assessments from fragmented data. Thirty-seven participants (37) diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS (EDSS range 0 to 4.5) executed two trials, walking 20 m each, with inertial sensors attached to their right and left shanks. Gait events were identified from the medio-lateral angular velocity, and short bouts of gait data were extracted from each trial, with lengths varying from 3 to 9 gait cycles. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) evaluate the degree of agreement between the two trials of each participant, according to the number of gait cycles included in the analysis. Results show that short bouts of gait data, including at least six gait cycles of bilateral data, can provide reliable gait measurements for persons with MS, opening new perspectives for gait assessment using fragmented data (e.g., wearable devices, community assessments). Stride time variability and asymmetry, as well as stride velocity variability and asymmetry, should be further explored as digital biomarkers to support the monitoring of symptoms of persons with neurological diseases.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2979810707","numberInSourceReferences":161,"doi":"10.1016/J.JNS.2019.116531","title":"Physical activity, sedentary behavior, and restless legs syndrome in persons with multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Katie L.J.

Participants with MS (N = 253) wore an accelerometer for a 7-day period and completed the Cambridge-Hopkins Restless Legs Syndrome Questionnaire, the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group Scale (IRLS), and the Patient Determined Disease Steps scale. Sixty-six (26%) persons with MS had RLS (MS + RLS). There were no differences between the MS + RLS and MS group for parameters of physical activity or sedentary behavior. Among participants with IRLS scores in the mild range (n = 26), more time spent in light physical activity (rs =  0.39), fewer sedentary bouts per day (rs = 0.55), less time in sedentary bouts per day (rs = 0.51), and fewer breaks in sedentary time per day (rs = 0.57) were associated with lower RLS severity. This study represents the first step toward recognizing a relationship between physical activity, patterns of sedentary behavior, and RLS severity in MS and these results suggest that light physical activity and the pattern of sedentary behavior may be important targets for prospective behavioral interventions that target the management of RLS in persons with MS who have mild RLS severity.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2941636603","numberInSourceReferences":174,"doi":"10.1016/J.CONCTC.2019.100366","title":"Do Social Cognitive Theory constructs explain response heterogeneity with a physical activity behavioral intervention in multiple sclerosis?","authors":[{"id":"Stephanie L.

The intervention consisted of two primary components, namely a dedicated Internet website and one-on-one video chats with a behavioral coach. Outcomes included objectively-measured moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) using Actigraph model GT3X+ accelerometers and self-reported physical activity using the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) as well as SCT variables of exercise self-efficacy, barriers self-efficacy, outcome expectations, goal setting and planning and facilitators/impediments.There was individual variability in physical activity change following the intervention. For example, 4/22 participants demonstrated a reduction in MVPA, 1/22 participants had no change, 9/22 participants had less than 0.5 standard deviation (SD) increase in MVPA, and 8/22 participants had an increase in MVPA of more than 0.5 SD. Baseline SCT variables, particularly outcome expectations, goal setting, planning, and barriers self-efficacy, correlated with increased physical activity.This study indicates that SCT variables correlate with the response heterogeneity associated with physical activity behavioral interventions, and this might inform the delivery of interventions consistent with Bandura's stepwise implementation model for optimizing the \"fit\" of an intervention based on SCT for maximizing treatment efficacy in MS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2467633427","numberInSourceReferences":104,"doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2016.2589902","title":"Causality Analysis of Inertial Body Sensors for Multiple Sclerosis Diagnostic Enhancement","authors":[{"id":"Jiaqi Gong","orcid":"0000-0001-9694-2518","LN":"Gong","FN":"Jiaqi","affil":"University of Virginia (US)","name":"Jiaqi Gong"},{"id":"Yanjun Qi","orcid":null,"LN":"Qi","FN":"Yanjun","affil":"University of Virginia (US)","name":"Yanjun Qi"},{"id":"Myla D.

This paper presents a causality analysis method focused on the coordination between extremities to identify subtle whole-body mobility impairment that may aid disease diagnosis. This method was developed for and utilized in an MS pilot study with 41 subjects (28 persons with MS (PwMS) and 13 healthy controls) performing 6 MW tests.

New technologies, such as smartphone monitoring in free-living conditions, could potentially aid in objectively assessing the symptoms of MS by quantifying symptom presence and intensity over long periods of time. Here, we present a deep-learning approach to diagnosing MS from smartphone-derived digital biomarkers that uses a novel combination of a multilayer perceptron with neural soft attention to improve learning of patterns in long-term smartphone monitoring data. Using data from a cohort of 774 participants, we demonstrate that our deep-learning models are able to distinguish between people with and without MS with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.88).

Method Persons with MS were recruited through the distribution of printed letters to a random sample of 1,000 persons from the North American Research Committee on MS registry. Two hundred ninety-five persons with MS were interested and volunteered to wear an ActiGraph accelerometer for a 7-day period and complete a battery of questionnaires that included the IPAQ-SF and Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire over this period of time. Results IPAQ-SF sitting time scores were consistently and moderately correlated with all of the sedentary behavior metrics from the accelerometer (range of r between .295 and .431), and the correlations were stronger than those between self-reported physical activity and sedentary metrics from the accelerometer (range of r between -.087 and .163). The correlations between IPAQ-SF sitting time scores with the accelerometer-derived sedentary behavior metrics were still statistically significant in the analyses controlling for physical activity (range of parametric correlations between .281 and .411). Conclusions The correlation analysis indicated consistent, moderate correlations between IPAQ-SF sitting time scores and device-measured estimates of both the volume and pattern of sedentary behavior, and the correlations were (a) stronger than those for self-reported physical activity and (b) independent of self-reported physical activity. Such results provide initial evidence for the validity of inferences from IPAQ-SF sitting time scores as an overall measure of sedentary behavior in persons with MS.

Methods: Balance control during stance and gait tasks of 24 remitting-phase patients (mean age 43.7 ± 10.5, 15 women, mean EDSS at baseline 2.45 ± 1.01) was examined every 3 months over 9 months and compared to that of nine relapsing patients (age 42.0 ± 12.7, all women, mean EDSS at relapse onset 3.11 ± 0.96) examined at relapse onset and 3 months later. Balance was also compared to that of 40 healthy controls (HCs) (age 39.7 ± 12.6, 25 women). Balance control was measured as lower-trunk sway angles with body-worn gyroscopes. Expanded Disability Status Scale scores (EDSS) were used to monitor, clinically, disease progression. Results: Remitting-phase patients showed more unstable stance balance control than HCs (p < 0.04) with no worsening over the observation period of 9 months. Gait balance control was normal (p > 0.06). Relapsing patients had stance balance control significantly worse at onset compared to remitting-phase patients and HCs (p < 0.04). Gait tasks showed a significant decrease of gait speed and trunk sway in relapsing patients (p = 0.018) compatible with having increased gait instability at normal speeds. Improvement to levels of remitting patients generally took longer than 3 months. Balance and EDSS scores were correlated for remitting but not for relapse patients. Conclusions: Balance in remitting RRMS patients does not change significantly over 9 months and correlated well with EDSS scores. Our results indicate that balance control is a useful measure to assess recovery after a relapse, particularly in patients with unchanged EDSS scores. Based on our results, balance could be considered as additional measurement to assess recovery after a relapse, particularly in patients with unchanged EDSS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2559891656","numberInSourceReferences":126,"doi":"10.1016/J.JNS.2016.11.070","title":"Physical activity, sedentary behavior, and aerobic capacity in persons with multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Robert W.

The authors hypothesized that physical activity and symptoms would be interrelated and that physical activity would be indirectly associated with disability through a pathway that involved functional limitations, whereas symptoms would be directly associated with both functional limitations and disability. Methods: Individuals with MS (N 133) who were recruited through a community organization wore an accelerometer for a 7-day period and completed a paper-and-pencil survey containing the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (G. Godin & R. J. Shephard, 1985), Symptom Inventory (C. E. Schwartz, T. Vollmer, & H. Lee, 1999), MS-Related Symptom Checklist (E. E.

Results: The standardized coefficients indicated that (a) physical activity and symptoms were negatively correlated ( .59); (b) those who were more physically active had better function ( .40); (c) those with fewer symptoms had better function ( .46) and less disability ( .29); and (d) those with better function had less disability ( .63).

The majority of research on sedentary behaviour in multiple sclerosis has been derived from self-report instruments that only measure the volume of sitting time per day.

Fatigue is the most common symptom in MS with a prevalence of 80%. Previous research studied the relation between fatigue and gait impairment using stationary gait analysis systems and short gait tests (e.g. timed 25 ft walk). However, wearable inertial sensors providing gait data from longer and continuous gait bouts have not been used to assess the relation between fatigue and gait parameters in MS. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between fatigue and spatio-temporal gait parameters extracted from wearable foot-worn sensors and to predict the degree of fatigue. Methods Forty-nine patients with MS (32 women; 17 men; aged 41.6 years, EDSS 1.0–6.5) were included where each participant was equipped with a small Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) on each foot. Spatio-temporal gait parameters were obtained from the 6-min walking test, and the Borg scale of perceived exertion was used to represent fatigue. Gait parameters were normalized by taking the difference of averaged gait parameters between the beginning and end of the test to eliminate inter-individual differences. Afterwards, normalized parameters were transformed to principle components that were used as input to a Random Forest regression model to formulate the relationship between gait parameters and fatigue. Results Six principal components were used as input to our model explaining more than 90% of variance within our dataset. Random Forest regression was used to predict fatigue. The model was validated using 10-fold cross validation and the mean absolute error was 1.38 points. Principal components consisting mainly of stride time, maximum toe clearance, heel strike angle, and stride length had large contributions (67%) to the predictions made by the Random Forest. Conclusions The level of fatigue can be predicted based on spatio-temporal gait parameters obtained from an IMU based system. The results can help therapists to monitor fatigue before and after treatment and in rehabilitation programs to evaluate their efficacy. Furthermore, this can be used in home monitoring scenarios where therapists can monitor fatigue using IMUs reducing time and effort of patients and therapists.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3094189869","numberInSourceReferences":199,"doi":"10.1002/ACN3.51224","title":"Walking in multiple sclerosis improves with tDCS: a randomized, double‐blind, sham‐controlled study","authors":[{"id":"Giuseppina Pilloni","orcid":"0000-0001-6226-5627","LN":"Pilloni","FN":"Giuseppina","affil":"University of Cagliari (IT)","name":"Giuseppina Pilloni"},{"id":"Claire Choi","orcid":null,"LN":"Choi","FN":"Claire","affil":"SUNY Downstate Medical Center (US)","name":"Claire Choi"},{"id":"Michael J.

The active group had a significantly greater increase in gait speed (0.87 vs. 1.20 m/s, p < 0.001) and distance covered during the 2-minute walking test (118.53 vs. 133.06 m, p < 0.001) at intervention end compared to baseline. At 4-week follow-up, these improvements were maintained (baseline vs. follow-up: gait speed 0.87 vs. 1.18 m/s, p < 0.001; distance traveled 118.53 vs. 143.82 m, p < 0.001). INTERPRETATION Multiple sessions of tDCS paired with aerobic exercise lead to cumulative and persisting improvements in walking and endurance in patients with MS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2341362536","numberInSourceReferences":102,"doi":"10.1080/10255842.2016.1140747","title":"Gyroscopic corrections improve wearable sensor data prior to measuring dynamic sway in the gait of people with Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Matthew A.

Optical motion capture was used as the gold standard. Improved wearable device accuracy (≤4.4% NRMSE) was achieved using gyroscopic corrections and scaling filter thresholds by step frequency. The people with MS presented significantly greater pelvis sway range to compensate for their lower limb weaknesses and joint contractures.

Due to these symptoms, people with MS are at a high risk for falls, fall-related injuries, and reductions in quality of life. There is no cure for MS, and managing symptoms and disease progression is important to maintain a high quality of life. Mobile health (mHealth) apps are commonly used by people with MS to help manage their health. However, there are limited health apps for people with MS designed to evaluate fall risk. A fall risk app can increase access to fall risk assessments and improve self-management. When designing mHealth apps, a user-centered approach is critical for improving use and adoption. Objective The purpose of this study is to undergo a user-centered approach to test and refine the usability of the app through an iterative design process. Methods The fall risk app Steady-MS is an extension of Steady, a fall risk app for older adults. Steady-MS consists of 2 components: a 25-item questionnaire about demographics and MS symptoms and 5 standing balance tasks. Data from the questionnaire and balance tasks were inputted into an algorithm to compute a fall risk score. Two iterations of semistructured interviews (n=5 participants per iteration) were performed to evaluate usability. People with MS used Steady-MS on a smartphone, thinking out loud. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and developed into codes and themes. People with MS also completed the System Usability Scale. Results A total of 3 themes were identified: intuitive navigation, efficiency of use, and perceived value. Overall, the participants found Steady-MS efficient to use and useful to learn their fall risk score. There were challenges related to cognitive overload during the balance tasks. Modifications were made, and after the second iteration, people with MS reported that the app was intuitive and efficient. Average System Usability Scale scores were 95.5 in both iterations, representing excellent usability. Conclusions Steady-MS is the first mHealth app for people with MS to assess their overall risk of falling and is usable by a subset of people with MS. People with MS found Steady-MS to be usable and useful for understanding their risk of falling. When developing future mHealth apps for people with MS, it is important to prevent cognitive overload through simple and clear instructions and present scores that are understood and interpreted correctly through visuals and text. These findings underscore the importance of user-centered design and provide a foundation for the future development of tools to assess and prevent scalable falls for people with MS. Future steps include understanding the validity of the fall risk algorithm and evaluating the clinical utility of the app.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3100723246","numberInSourceReferences":209,"doi":"10.1063/5.0022031","title":"Early-warning signals for disease activity in patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis based on keystroke dynamics","authors":[{"id":"J.

Due to the underlying conditions of homogeneity and stationarity (the main tenets of ergodicity) not being met for the majority of the statistical methods employed in the clinical setting, alternative approaches should be investigated. A solution is to use a non-linear time series analysis approach. Here, Early-Warning Signals (EWS) in the form of critical fluctuations in Keystroke Dynamics (KD), collected using participant's smartphones, are investigated as indicators for a clinical change in three groups. These are patients with MS and changes in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), patients with MS but without changes in MRI, and healthy controls (HCs). Here, we report examples of EWS and changes in KD coinciding with clinically relevant changes in outcome measures in both patients with and without differences in the amount of MRI enhancing lesions. We also report no clinically relevant changes in EWS in the HC population.

Technological advances in biomechanics offer objective assessments of gait disabilities in clinical settings. Here we employed wearable sensors to measure electromyography (EMG) and body acceleration during walking and to quantify the altered gait pattern between people with progressive MS (PwPMS) and healthy controls (HCs). Forty consecutive patients attending our department as in-patients were examined together with fifteen healthy controls. All subjects performed the timed 10 min walking test (T10MW) using a wearable accelerator and 8 electrodes attached to bilateral thighs and legs so that body acceleration and EMG activity were recorded. The T10MWs were recorded under three conditions: standard (wearing shoes), reduced grip (wearing socks) and increased cognitive load (backward-counting dual-task). PwPMS showed worse kinematics of gait and increased muscle coactivation than controls at both the thigh and leg levels. Both reduced grip and increased cognitive load caused a reduction in the cadence and velocity of the T10MW, which were correlated with one another. A higher coactivation index at the thigh level of the more affected side was positively correlated with the time of the T10MW (r = 0.5, p &lt; 0.01), Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) (r = 0.4, p &lt; 0.05), and negatively correlated with the cadence (r = −0.6, p &lt; 0.001). Our results suggest that excessive coactivation at the thigh level is the major determinant of the gait performance as the disease progresses. Moreover, demanding walking conditions do not influence gait in controls but deteriorate walking performances in PwPMS, thus those conditions should be prevented during hospital examinations as well as in homecare environments.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3006688423","numberInSourceReferences":202,"doi":"10.1016/J.MSARD.2020.102031","title":"Rapid foot-tapping but not hand-tapping ability is different between relapsing-remitting and progressive multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Sumire Sato","orcid":null,"LN":"Sato","FN":"Sumire","affil":"University of Massachusetts Amherst (US)","name":"Sumire Sato"},{"id":"Jongil Lim","orcid":null,"LN":"Lim","FN":"Jongil","affil":"Texas A&M University – San Antonio (US)","name":"Jongil Lim"},{"id":"Jules D.

To successfully perform rapid repetitive movements such as tapping, a person must be able to consistently turn on and off motor units to switch between the up and down movement phases. However, it is not clear which specific movement phase that occurs during tapping is different between MS subtypes. The objective of this study was to quantify and characterize performance differences during rapid hand- and foot-tapping tests between relapsing-remitting (RRMS) and progressive (PMS) forms of MS, as well as how both subtypes differ from non-MS controls.Participants in this study included 30 non-MS controls, 32 RRMS, and 31 PMS. Participants wore inertial sensors on all hands and feet and were instructed to tap as fast as possible for 10 s. Angular velocity from the gyroscope was used to quantify inter-tap interval (ms), coefficient of variation of inter-tap interval (COV), and up- and down-movement characteristics (duration (ms), COV, peak angular velocity (rad/s)). Differences between groups were examined with ANOVA and independent t-tests. Inter-tap interval was examined for its ability to distinguish between RRMS and PMS by a binary logistic regression analysis. Up-down movement characteristics were further evaluated for within-group directional differences (up- vs. down-phase movement components) with paired-sample t-tests.Inter-tap interval for both hand- and foot-tapping differed between controls and MS, but only foot tapping was different between RRMS and PMS (RRMS = 286.7 ± 83.0 ms; PMS = 379.5 ± 170.9 ms; mean difference (d) = -92.8 ms). Logistic regression analysis showed foot-tap interval but not hand-tap interval has the potential to distinguish between RRMS and PMS (Area under the ROC = 0.71). Both up- and down-movement duration differences were consistent with the results for inter-tap interval, but up-movement duration showed larger mean group differences than down-movement differences. No significant group differences in overall inter-tap interval COV were detected for either hand- or foot-tapping; however, up-movement foot-tapping variation (CON = 18.7 ± 6.1; RRMS = 25.5 ± 11.2; PMS = 23.3 ± 8.6; CON vs RRMS d = -6.8; CON vs PMS d = -4.7), but not down-movement variation was different between controls and MS. Up- and down-peak angular velocity during foot-tapping were different between controls and PMS (CON Up = 1.4 ± 0.5 rad/s; PMS Up = 1.0 ± 0.4 rad/s; Up d = 0.4 rad/s; CON Down= 1.5 ± 0.6 rad/s; PMS Down = 1.2 ± 0.5 rad/s; Down d = 0.3 rad/s), and up-movement peak angular velocity differences showed larger mean group differences than the down-movement peak angular velocity between controls and PMS.Foot-tapping differs between MS disease subtypes and has greater potential than hand-tapping to distinguish between subtypes. Performance in the up-movement showed larger group differences than the down-movement, suggesting that the anti-gravity up-movement during tapping may be more important diagnostically. Future studies should be conducted on the nature of the physiological mechanisms underlying impairments in anti-gravity movements in people with MS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2749921372","numberInSourceReferences":132,"doi":"10.1177/0308022617726259","title":"Objective identification of upper limb tremor in multiple sclerosis using a wrist-worn motion sensor: Establishing validity and reliability","authors":[{"id":"Stefan Teufl","orcid":null,"LN":"Teufl","FN":"Stefan","affil":"Glasgow Caledonian University (GB)","name":"Stefan Teufl"},{"id":"Jenny Preston","orcid":null,"LN":"Preston","FN":"Jenny","affil":"NHS Ayrshire and Arran (GB)","name":"Jenny Preston"},{"id":"Frederike van Wijck","orcid":"0000-0003-0855-799X","LN":"Wijck","FN":"Frederike van","affil":"Glasgow Caledonian University (GB)","name":"Frederike van Wijck"},{"id":"Ben Stansfield","orcid":null,"LN":"Stansfield","FN":"Ben","affil":"Glasgow Caledonian University (GB)","name":"Ben Stansfield"}],"year":2017,"journal":"British Journal of Occupational Therapy","references":["W602776625","W1848042302","W1978473739","W2058250069","W2069930252","W2084156920","W2085126485","W2088544038","W2092599090","W2112171382","W2117961309","W2122545833","W2135154607","W4211254511","W4251598398"],"citationsCount":6,"abstract":"Introduction Over 25% of people with multiple sclerosis experience tremor, which may impact on activities of daily living and quality of life. Yet there is no method to objectively measure tremor and effectiveness of interventions on tremor. This study aimed to test validity and reliability of a new objective measurement for upper limb tremor in people with multiple sclerosis. Method Twelve participants with multiple sclerosis who self-reported tremor were observed performing standardised tasks. Validity and reliability of a new method to detect tremor from wrist movement was established against occupational therapist observation of tremor (FAHN). Concurrent validity of severity (displacement) of tremor was assessed. Responsiveness to change in tremor characteristics was explored in a sub-set of participants using weighted wrist-cuffs. Results The new method correctly predicted 98.2% of tremor cases identified by the occupational therapist, with high sensitivity (0.988) and specificity (0.976). Calculated displacement of tremor correlated with FAHN tremor severity scores moderately (rs = .452, p = .004). The new measure was responsive to changes in tremor characteristics due to change in weight of wrist-cuffs. Conclusion The new method of characterising tremor in those with multiple sclerosis demonstrated excellent validity and reliability in relation to tremor identified by an occupational therapist, and could provide valuable objective insight into the efficacy of interventions.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2489877216","numberInSourceReferences":110,"doi":"10.1109/BSN.2016.7516271","title":"Determining physiological significance of inertial gait features in multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Sriram Raju Dandu","orcid":"0000-0003-2979-8549","LN":"Dandu","FN":"Sriram Raju","affil":"University of Virginia (US)","name":"Sriram Raju Dandu"},{"id":"Matthew M.

Walking speed is the primary measure of gait impairment used by clinical researchers, but inertial gait features from body-worn sensors have been proven to add clinical value. This paper seeks to understand the physiologic significance of two such features in MS. Both features are computed using the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm: the “DTW Score” is based on the usual DTW distance, and the “Warp Score” is based on the warping length. Using linear regression and stepwise regression models, the relationship between these features and several gait-related MS symptoms is analyzed. Results show that the DTW Score and Warp Score have distinct physiologic significance in MS compared to walking speed, and these features may also be useful for walking assessment in a wide range of clinical contexts.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2092226485","numberInSourceReferences":60,"doi":"10.1016/J.JNS.2012.10.007","title":"The dynamics of finger tremor in multiple sclerosis is affected by whole body position","authors":[{"id":"Shaunna M.

Bilateral postural tremor was recorded using accelerometers attached to each index finger. Results revealed some similarity of tremor between groups in regard to the principal features (e.g., presence of peaks in similar frequency ranges). However, significant differences were observed with tremor for the MS persons being of greater amplitude, more regular (lower ApEn) and more strongly coupled across limbs compared to the elderly. The effects of body position were consistent across all subjects, with tremor increasing significantly from sitting-to-standing. However, the tremor increase for the MS group was greater than the elderly.

Forty-one PwMS and 16 healthy persons participated in this study. Their physical activity in real-life conditions was assessed with an accelerometer.

PwMS had a constant level of activity throughout the week, whereas the reference group increased its level of activity on Saturdays (p = 0.04, d = 0.69). The level of activity was correlated in descending order with multiple sclerosis disability, body mass index, gait velocity, six-minute walk test, and timed up and go test. This study showed that PwMS had a stable level of activity throughout the week, contrary to healthy persons.

Detection of progression onset or worsening of symptoms is especially important in people living with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) in order to enable optimally adapted therapeutic strategies. MS symptoms typically follow subtle and fluctuating disease courses, patient-to-patient, and over time. Current in-clinic assessments are often too infrequently administered to reflect longitudinal changes in MS impairment that impact daily life. This work, therefore, explores how smartphones can administer daily two-minute walking assessments to monitor PwMS physical function at home. Methods: Remotely collected smartphone inertial sensor data was transformed through state-of-the-art Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, to estimate a participant's daily ambulatory-related disease severity, longitudinally over a 24-week study. Results: This study demonstrated that smartphone-based ambulatory severity outcomes could accurately estimate MS level of disability, as measured by the EDSS score ([Formula: see text]: 0.56,[Formula: see text]0.001). Furthermore, longitudinal severity outcomes were shown to accurately reflect individual participants' level of disability over the study duration. Conclusion: Smartphone-based assessments, that can be performed by patients from their home environments, could greatly augment standard in-clinic outcomes for neurodegenerative diseases. The ability to understand the impact of disease on daily-life between clinical visits, through objective digital outcomes, paves the way forward to better measure and identify signs of disease progression that may be occurring out-of-clinic, to monitor how different patients respond to various treatments, and to ultimately enable the development of better, and more personalised care.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4296046672","numberInSourceReferences":294,"doi":"10.3390/S22186982","title":"How Much Data Is Enough?

Data supporting the minimal duration of sensor wear, which is necessary to capture representative variability in impairment measures, are needed to balance patient burden, data quality, and study cost. Prior investigations have examined the duration required for resolving a variety of movement variables (e.g., gait speed, sit-to-stand tests), but these studies use differing methodologies and have only examined a small subset of potential measures of gait and balance impairment. Notably, postural sway measures have not yet been considered in these analyses. Here, we propose a three-level framework for examining this problem. Difference testing and intra-class correlations (ICC) are used to examine the agreement in features computed from potential wear durations (levels one and two). The association between features and established patient reported outcomes at each wear duration is also considered (level three) for determining the necessary wear duration. Utilizing wearable accelerometer data continuously collected from 22 persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) for 6 weeks, this framework suggests that 2 to 3 days of monitoring may be sufficient to capture most of the variability in gait and sway; however, longer periods (e.g., 3 to 6 days) may be needed to establish strong correlations to patient-reported clinical measures. Regression analysis indicates that the required wear duration depends on both the observation frequency and variability of the measure being considered. This approach provides a framework for evaluating wear duration as one aspect of the comprehensive assessment, which is necessary to ensure that wearable sensor-based methods for capturing gait and balance impairment in the free-living environment are fit for purpose.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4281293261","numberInSourceReferences":264,"doi":"10.3389/FNEUR.2022.860008","title":"Making Every Step Count: Minute-by-Minute Characterization of Step Counts Augments Remote Activity Monitoring in People With Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Valerie J Block","orcid":null,"LN":"Block","FN":"Valerie J","affil":"University of California, San Francisco (US)","name":"Valerie J Block"},{"id":"Matthew Waliman","orcid":null,"LN":"Waliman","FN":"Matthew","affil":"University of California, San Francisco (US)","name":"Matthew Waliman"},{"id":"Zhendong Xie","orcid":null,"LN":"Xie","FN":"Zhendong","affil":"University of California, San Francisco (US)","name":"Zhendong Xie"},{"id":"Amit Akula","orcid":null,"LN":"Akula","FN":"Amit","affil":"University of California, San Francisco (US)","name":"Amit Akula"},{"id":"Riley Bove","orcid":"0000-0002-2034-8800","LN":"Bove","FN":"Riley","affil":"University of California, San Francisco (US)","name":"Riley Bove"},{"id":"Mark J.

Remote monitoring using average daily step count (STEPS) can assess physical activity (activity) and disability in MS. STEPS correlates with conventional metrics such as the expanded disability status scale (Expanded Disability Status Scale; EDSS), Timed-25 Foot walk (T25FW) and timed up and go (TUG). However, while STEPS as a summative measure characterizes the number of steps taken over a day, it does not reflect variability and intensity of activity. Objectives Novel analytical methods were developed to describe how individuals spends time in various activity levels (e.g., continuous low versus short bouts of high) and the proportion of time spent at each activity level. Methods 94 people with MS spanning the range of ambulatory impairment (unaffected to requiring bilateral assistance) were recruited into FITriMS study and asked to wear a Fitbit continuously for 1-year. Parametric distributions were fit to minute-by-minute step data. Adjusted R 2 values for regressions between distributional fit parameters and STEPS with EDSS, TUG, T25FW and the patient-reported 12-item MS Walking scale (MSWS-12) were calculated over the first 4-weeks, adjusting for sex, age and disease duration. Results Distributional fits determined that the best statistically-valid model across all subjects was a 3-compartment Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) that characterizes the step behavior within 3 levels of activity: high, moderate and low. The correlation of GMM parameters for baseline step count measures with clinical assessments was improved when compared with STEPS (adjusted R 2 values GMM vs. STEPS: TUG: 0.536 vs. 0.419, T25FW: 0.489 vs. 0.402, MSWS-12: 0.383 vs. 0.378, EDSS: 0.557 vs. 0.465). The GMM correlated more strongly (Kruskal-Wallis: p = 0.0001) than STEPS and gave further information not included in STEPS. Conclusions Individuals' step distributions follow a 3-compartment GMM that better correlates with clinic-based performance measures compared with STEPS. These data support the existence of high-moderate-low levels of activity. GMM provides an interpretable framework to better understand the association between different levels of activity and clinical metrics and allows further analysis of walking behavior that takes step distribution and proportion of time at three levels of intensity into account.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3214280004","numberInSourceReferences":256,"doi":"10.2196/29128","title":"A Two-Minute Walking Test With a Smartphone App for Persons With Multiple Sclerosis: Validation Study","authors":[{"id":"Pim van Oirschot","orcid":"0000-0003-1135-0500","LN":"Oirschot","FN":"Pim van","affil":"Orikami Digital Health Products, Nijmegen, Netherlands.","name":"Pim van Oirschot"},{"id":"Marco Heerings","orcid":null,"LN":"Heerings","FN":"Marco","affil":"Dutch National Multiple Sclerosis Foundation, Rotterdam, Netherlands., Radboud University Nijmegen (NL)","name":"Marco Heerings"},{"id":"Karine Wendrich","orcid":"0000-0001-9413-1674","LN":"Wendrich","FN":"Karine","affil":"Radboud University Nijmegen (NL)","name":"Karine Wendrich"},{"id":"Bram den Teuling","orcid":"0000-0001-9084-5645","LN":"Teuling","FN":"Bram den","affil":"Orikami Digital Health Products, Nijmegen, Netherlands.","name":"Bram den Teuling"},{"id":"Frank Dorssers","orcid":null,"LN":"Dorssers","FN":"Frank","affil":"Orikami Digital Health Products, Nijmegen, Netherlands.","name":"Frank Dorssers"},{"id":"René Frederik Van Ee","orcid":null,"LN":"Ee","FN":"René Frederik Van","affil":"Orikami Digital Health Products, Nijmegen, Netherlands.","name":"René Frederik Van Ee"},{"id":"Marijn Martens","orcid":"0000-0001-6264-0343","LN":"Martens","FN":"Marijn","affil":"Target (US)","name":"Marijn Martens"},{"id":"Peter Joseph Jongen","orcid":null,"LN":"Jongen","FN":"Peter Joseph","affil":"University Medical Center Groningen (NL)","name":"Peter Joseph Jongen"}],"year":2021,"journal":"JMIR formative research","references":["W1494341793","W1530898409","W1556779599","W1873321488","W1993618946","W2013846651","W2019944740","W2023941008","W2036768089","W2043572283","W2043979211","W2067724039","W2093612473","W2095310389","W2109084720","W2112165124","W2141062585","W2151621222","W2159306398","W2318611315","W2521634683","W2626779661","W2755715597","W2763877147","W2793521216","W2803725659","W2883576155","W2899971745","W2942524328","W2945555875","W2970657297","W2974007026","W2995629548","W3019509938","W3030156391","W3089623732","W3093426924","W3093779021","W3098440421","W3153945493","W3165015517","W4240787498"],"citationsCount":3,"abstract":"Walking disturbances are a common dysfunction in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). The 2-Minute Walking Test (2MWT) is widely used to quantify walking speed. We implemented a smartphone-based 2MWT (s2MWT) in MS sherpa, an app for persons with MS. When performing the s2MWT, users of the app are instructed to walk as fast as safely possible for 2 minutes in the open air, while the app records their movement and calculates the distance walked.The aim of this study is to investigate the concurrent validity and test-retest reliability of the MS sherpa s2MWT.We performed a validation study on 25 persons with relapsing-remitting MS and 79 healthy control (HC) participants. In the HC group, 21 participants were matched to the persons with MS based on age, gender, and education and these followed the same assessment schedule as the persons with MS (the HC-matched group), whereas 58 participants had a less intense assessment schedule to determine reference values (the HC-normative group). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were determined between the distance measured by the s2MWT and the distance measured using distance markers on the pavement during these s2MWT assessments. ICCs were also determined for test-retest reliability and derived from 10 smartphone tests per study participant, with 3 days in between each test. We interviewed 7 study participants with MS regarding their experiences with the s2MWT.In total, 755 s2MWTs were completed. The adherence rate for the persons with MS and the participants in the HC-matched group was 92.4% (425/460). The calculated distance walked on the s2MWT was, on average, 8.43 m or 5% (SD 18.9 m or 11%) higher than the distance measured using distance markers (n=43). An ICC of 0.817 was found for the concurrent validity of the s2MWT in the combined analysis of persons with MS and HC participants. Average ICCs of 9 test-retest reliability analyses of the s2MWT for persons with MS and the participants in the HC-matched group were 0.648 (SD 0.150) and 0.600 (SD 0.090), respectively, whereas the average ICC of 2 test-retest reliability analyses of the s2MWT for the participants in the HC-normative group was 0.700 (SD 0.029). The interviewed study participants found the s2MWT easy to perform, but they also expressed that the test results can be confronting and that a pressure to reach a certain distance can be experienced.The high correlation between s2MWT distance and the conventional 2MWT distance indicates a good concurrent validity. Similarly, high correlations underpin a good test-retest reliability of the s2MWT. We conclude that the s2MWT can be used to measure the distance that the persons with MS walk in 2 minutes outdoors near their home, from which both clinical studies and clinical practice can benefit.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3049593359","numberInSourceReferences":212,"doi":"10.3389/FNEUR.2020.00688","title":"Smartphone Accelerometry: A Smart and Reliable Measurement of Real-Life Physical Activity in Multiple Sclerosis and Healthy Individuals","authors":[{"id":"Yuyang Zhai","orcid":null,"LN":"Zhai","FN":"Yuyang","affil":"Eppendorf (DE)","name":"Yuyang Zhai"},{"id":"Navina N Nasseri","orcid":null,"LN":"Nasseri","FN":"Navina N","affil":"Eppendorf (DE)","name":"Navina N Nasseri"},{"id":"Jana Pöttgen","orcid":"0000-0002-6665-2154","LN":"Pöttgen","FN":"Jana","affil":"Eppendorf (DE)","name":"Jana Pöttgen"},{"id":"Eghbal Gezhelbash","orcid":null,"LN":"Gezhelbash","FN":"Eghbal","affil":"Eppendorf (DE)","name":"Eghbal Gezhelbash"},{"id":"Christoph Heesen","orcid":"0000-0001-8131-9467","LN":"Heesen","FN":"Christoph","affil":"Eppendorf (DE)","name":"Christoph Heesen"},{"id":"Jan-Patrick Stellmann","orcid":null,"LN":"Stellmann","FN":"Jan-Patrick","affil":"Eppendorf (DE)","name":"Jan-Patrick Stellmann"}],"year":2020,"journal":"Frontiers in Neurology","references":["W16535422","W165388696","W1975984765","W1993618946","W2006189386","W2007757525","W2008532656","W2014898932","W2024893011","W2028664517","W2049223663","W2051274614","W2058027663","W2071134780","W2073323987","W2074076764","W2074204025","W2080140456","W2082124972","W2086199715","W2095237464","W2098291431","W2110606669","W2112165124","W2114060341","W2122545833","W2124775720","W2126737632","W2142577589","W2143567192","W2146042523","W2148930341","W2171129594","W2296610931","W2321149532","W2342870422","W2477359521","W2557274736","W2601117134","W2603241070","W2606583490","W2764204146","W2765429604","W2774768051","W2793898992","W2921754847"],"citationsCount":10,"abstract":"Background: Mobility impairment is common in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) and can be assessed with clinical tests and surveys that have restricted ecological validity. Commercial research-based accelerometers are considered to be more valuable as they measure real-life mobility. Smartphone accelerometry might be an easily accessible alternative. Objective: To explore smartphone accelerometry in comparison to clinical tests, surveys, and a wrist-worn ActiGraph in pwMS and controls. Methods: Sixty-seven pwMS and 70 matched controls underwent mobility tests and surveys. Real-life data were collected with a smartphone and an ActiGraph over 7 days. We explored different smartphone metrics in a technical validation course and computed afterward correlation between ActiGraph (steps per minute), smartphone accelerometry (variance of vector magnitude), clinical tests, and surveys. We also determined the ability to separate between patients and controls as well as between different disability groups. Results: Based on the technical validation, we found the variance of the vector magnitude as a reliable estimate to discriminate wear time and no wear-time of the smartphone. Due to a further association with different activity levels, it was selected for real-life analyses. In the cross-sectional study, ActiGraph correlated moderately (r = 0.43, p < 0.05) with the smartphone but less with clinical tests (rho between |0.211| and |0.337|). Smartphone data showed stronger correlations with age (rho = -0.487) and clinical tests (rho between |0.565| and |0.605|). ActiGraph only differed between pwMS and controls (p < 0.001) but not between disability groups. At the same time, the smartphone showed differences between pwMS and controls, between RRMS and PP-/SPMS, and between participants with/without ambulatory impairment (all p < 0.001). Conclusions: Smartphone accelerometry provides better estimates of mobility and disability than a wrist-worn standard accelerometer in a free-living context for both controls and pwMS. Given the fact that no additional device is needed, smartphone accelerometry might be a convenient outcome of real-life ambulation in healthy individuals and chronic diseases such as MS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2990745514","numberInSourceReferences":157,"doi":"10.1177/2055217319888660","title":"Validation of a consumer-grade activity monitor for continuous daily activity monitoring in individuals with multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Valerie J Block","orcid":null,"LN":"Block","FN":"Valerie J","affil":"Weill Institute for Neurosciences, Department of Neurology, University of California, San Francisco.

Inertial sensors (IMUs) could overcome this drawback. Nevertheless, IMUs are not yet fully integrated into clinical practice due to issues including the difficulty to understand/interpret the big number of parameters provided and the lack of cut-off values to identify possible abnormalities. In an attempt to overcome these limitations, an instrumented modified Romberg test (ImRomberg: standing on foam with eyes closed while wearing an IMU on the trunk) was administered to 81 early-stage PwMS and 38 healthy subjects (HS). To facilitate clinical interpretation, 21 IMU-based parameters were computed and reduced through principal component analysis into two components, sway complexity and sway intensity, descriptive of independent aspects of balance, presenting a clear clinical meaning and significant correlations with at least one clinical scale. Compared to HS, early-stage PwMS showed a 228% reduction in sway complexity and a 63% increase in sway intensity, indicating, respectively, a less automatic (more conscious) balance control and larger and faster trunk movements during upright posture. Cut-off values were derived to identify the presence of balance abnormalities and if these abnormalities are clinically meaningful. By applying these thresholds and integrating the ImRomberg test with the clinical tandem gait test, balance impairments were identified in 58% of PwMS versus the 17% detected by traditional Romberg and tandem gait tests. The higher sensitivity of the proposed approach would allow for the direct identification of early-stage PwMS who could benefit from preventive rehabilitation interventions aimed at slowing MS-related functional decline during neurological examinations and with minimal modifications to the tests commonly performed.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4205904659","numberInSourceReferences":269,"doi":"10.1016/J.APMR.2021.12.022","title":"Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior Timing in Fatigued and Nonfatigued Adults With Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Katie L.J.

To date, researchers have applied theory such as Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) for identifying correlates of physical activity that can then inform the design and delivery of behavioral interventions. Such research often has been conducted in heterogeneous samples of persons with MS without a focus on those with a specific symptom, such as fatigue, that may be targeted by physical activity behavioral interventions. To that end, this study examined SCT variables (i.e., self-efficacy, barriers, outcome expectations, goal-setting, planning, social support, and functional limitations) as correlates of physical activity in persons with MS who self-reported elevated fatigue. <h3>Methods</h3> Persons with MS (N=210; aged 49.6[13.2] years) who ambulated with or without assistance participated in the study. Participants completed self-report measures of fatigue, physical activity, and SCT variables and wore an ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer on a belt around the waist for 7 days. The accelerometer data were processed and delineated into time spent in light and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) based on MS-specific cut-points. We generated groups of fatigued (n=134) and non-fatigued (n=76) persons with MS based on the cut-off score of 4 for the Fatigue Severity Scale. <h3>Results</h3> There were differences in physical activity and SCT variables between fatigued and non-fatigued persons with MS. Among those with fatigue, functional limitations (<i>ρ</i>=0.52), self-efficacy (<i>ρ</i>=0.31), and goal-setting (<i>ρ</i>=0.25) were associated with device-measured MVPA, and all SCT variables except outcome expectations were associated with self-reported physical activity. The regression analyses indicated self-efficacy, functional limitations, and goal-setting as significant correlates of MVPA in those with fatigue. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Self-efficacy, goal-setting, and social support may be important targets of SCT-based behavioral interventions for increasing physical activity among persons with MS who have fatigue.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4280571549","numberInSourceReferences":285,"doi":"10.1016/J.MSARD.2022.103889","title":"Do device-measured physical activity and sedentary behavior differ by depression symptom status in persons with multiple sclerosis?","authors":[{"id":"C.

There are data indicating that the volume of physical activity behavior differs by depression symptom status in MS, yet less is known about the volume of sedentary behavior and its relationship with depression. We further know little about physical activity patterns and sedentary behavior and depression in MS.This study examined differences in the volume (i.e., minutes/day) and pattern (i.e., bouts/day or bout length) of device-measured sedentary behavior and physical activity as a function of depression symptom status in persons with MS.The sample of adults with MS (N=441) completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and wore a waist-mounted ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer during waking hours for 7 days. Participants were divided into subgroups of elevated (n=127) or non-elevated (n=314) depression symptoms based on a cut-point for the HADS scores (i.e., 8+ as indicative of elevated depressive symptoms). We examined the effect of depression group status differences on volume and pattern of sedentary behavior and light (LPA) and moderate-to-vigorous (MVPA) physical activity between subgroups using multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) and then multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) controlling for demographic/clinical variables that differed between the elevated and non-elevated depression groups.Results of the MANOVA indicated an overall difference between subgroups in the volume, but not pattern, of physical activity and sedentary behavior. The non-elevated depression group had a significantly greater amount of steps/day (mean [M]=4584.3, standard deviation [SD]=2821.3), than the elevated depression group ([M]=3729.6, [SD]=2576.3, F=8.7; p=.003). Results of the MANCOVA revealed there was no statistically significant difference between the elevated and non-elevated depression groups in measures of volume of physical activity, and the difference in steps/day became non-significant F(1,438)= 2.13, p=.146), after controlling for disability, age, disease duration, and educations years.This study observed no differences in sedentary behavior and physical activity as a function of depression symptom status in persons with MS, yet there was a difference in steps/day initially. Results demonstrated that when disability, age, disease duration, and years of education are included in the MANCOVA, the difference in depression groups is no longer significant. This suggests that steps/day could be an important target of health promotion interventions among persons with MS who have higher disability and elevated depression symptoms.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4224952700","numberInSourceReferences":296,"doi":"10.1016/J.MSARD.2022.103833","title":"Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity is associated with processing speed, but not learning and memory, in cognitively impaired persons with multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Robert W.

Previous work focused on studying activity levels or activity volume, but studies of daily-living rest-activity fragmentation patterns, circadian rhythms, and fractal regulation in pwMS are limited. Based on findings in other cohorts, one could suggest that these aspects of daily-living physical activity will provide additional information about the health and well-being of pwMS. Therefore, here, we aimed to (1) identify which fragmentation, fractal, and circadian amplitude measures differ between pwMS and healthy controls, (2) evaluate the relationship between fragmentation, fractal, and circadian amplitude measures and disease severity, and (3) begin to evaluate the added value of those measures, as compared to more conventional measures of physical activity (e.g., mean signal vector magnitude (SVM). A global measure of the overall volume of physical activity). Methods 132 people with relapsing-remitting MS (47±11 yrs, 69.7% female, Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS, median (IQR): 3 (2–4)) and 90 healthy controls (46±11 yrs, 47.8% female) were asked to wear a 3D accelerometer on their lower back for 7 days. Rest-activity fragmentation, circadian amplitude, fractal regulation, and mean SVM metrics were extracted. PwMS and healthy controls were compared using independent samples t-tests and linear regression, including comparisons adjusted for mean SVM to control for the effect of physical activity volume. Spearman correlations between measures and logistic regressions were used to identify the clinical condition based on the measures that differed significantly after adjusting for SVM. All analyses included adjustments for demographic and clinical parameters (e.g., age, sex). Results Multiple measures of activity fragmentation significantly differed between pwMS and healthy controls, reflecting a more fragmented active behavior in pwMS. PwMS had a lower circadian rhythm amplitude, indicating a smaller amplitude in the circadian changes of daily activity, and weaker temporal correlations as based on the fractal analysis. When taking into account physical activity volume, one circadian amplitude measure and one fractal measure remained significantly different in pwMS and controls. Fragmentation measures and circadian amplitude measures were significantly associated with disability level as measured by the EDSS; the association with circadian amplitude remained significant, even after adjusting for the mean SVM. Conclusion The physical activity patterns of pwMS differ from those of healthy individuals in rest-activity fragmentation, the amplitude of the circadian rhythm, and fractal regulation. Measures describing these aspects of activity provide information that is not captured in the total volume of physical activity and could, perhaps, augment the monitoring of disease progression and evaluation of the response to interventions.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2017081954","numberInSourceReferences":69,"doi":"10.1016/J.CLINEURO.2014.04.021","title":"Recovery of peripheral muscle function from fatiguing exercise and daily physical activity level in patients with multiple sclerosis: A case-control study","authors":[{"id":"Kelly Ickmans","orcid":"0000-0003-0751-6504","LN":"Ickmans","FN":"Kelly","affil":"Pain in Motion (BE), Vrije Universiteit Brussel (BE)","name":"Kelly Ickmans"},{"id":"Fauve Simoens","orcid":null,"LN":"Simoens","FN":"Fauve","affil":"Pain in Motion (BE), Vrije Universiteit Brussel (BE)","name":"Fauve Simoens"},{"id":"Jo Nijs","orcid":null,"LN":"Nijs","FN":"Jo","affil":"Pain in Motion (BE), Vrije Universiteit Brussel (BE)","name":"Jo Nijs"},{"id":"Daphne Kos","orcid":null,"LN":"Kos","FN":"Daphne","affil":"Pain in Motion (BE), KU Leuven (BE), Ghent University (BE)","name":"Daphne Kos"},{"id":"Patrick Cras","orcid":null,"LN":"Cras","FN":"Patrick","affil":"University of Antwerp (BE)","name":"Patrick Cras"},{"id":"Barbara Willekens","orcid":null,"LN":"Willekens","FN":"Barbara","affil":"University of Antwerp (BE)","name":"Barbara Willekens"},{"id":"Mira Meeus","orcid":"0000-0002-2022-5114","LN":"Meeus","FN":"Mira","affil":"Ghent University (BE)","name":"Mira Meeus"}],"year":2014,"journal":"Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery","references":["W1593456877","W1849469560","W1963943841","W1966335503","W1972577310","W1980652514","W1981308841","W1985186735","W1987351461","W1999186423","W2008609876","W2009836285","W2019918633","W2020022772","W2020169640","W2023227451","W2029016520","W2031358440","W2036601018","W2050132104","W2056737407","W2061561607","W2061693020","W2066703376","W2068077411","W2068329556","W2068967233","W2075980297","W2078776394","W2079481888","W2079954077","W2085204961","W2086414808","W2087952971","W2090866605","W2094667366","W2098604997","W2100619969","W2102471539","W2103110795","W2105490558","W2107813574","W2108752110","W2113922021","W2116416756","W2133775664","W2139889284","W2154514379","W2158457970","W2159018172","W2160404429","W2171212718","W2171558385","W2176880214","W2916040650","W4241890711"],"citationsCount":11,"abstract":"Delayed recovery of muscle function following exercise has been demonstrated in the lower limbs of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).

Seven days of passive monitoring of gait and turning were carried out in a pilot study of 26 PwMS in home settings using wearable inertial sensors. The retrospective fall history was collected at the baseline. After gait and turning data collection in daily life, PwMS were followed biweekly for a year and were classified as fallers if they experienced >1 fall. The ability of short-term passive monitoring of gait and turning, as well as retrospective fall history to predict future falls were compared using receiver operator curves and regression analysis. The history of retrospective falls was not identified as a significant predictor of future falls in this cohort (AUC = 0.62, p = 0.32). Among quantitative monitoring measures of gait and turning, the pitch at toe-off was the best predictor of falls (AUC = 0.86, p < 0.01). Fallers had a smaller pitch of their feet at toe-off, reflecting less plantarflexion during the push-off phase of walking, which can impact forward propulsion and swing initiation and can result in poor foot clearance and an increased metabolic cost of walking. In conclusion, our cohort of PwMS showed that objective monitoring of gait and turning in daily life can identify those at future risk of falls, and the pitch at toe-off was the single most influential predictor of future falls.

Demographic and clinical data were recorded at the hospital during the baseline assessment. Subjects wore the wrist GENEActiv accelerometer for 7-days. Data were collected at 100 Hz and summarized into a motor activity (MA) index using 60 s epochs with the following thresholds: MANPA-LPA: 10mG, MALPA-MPA: 100mG, MAMPA-VPA: 350mG.PwMS show higher NPA and lower VPA compared to matched healthy subjects (NPA: Mean±SD, HS: 7.2 ± 0.9 h/day; PwMS: 8.1 ± 1.2 h/day, p<0.01; VPA: HS: 0.78± 0.42 h/day; PwMS: 0.50± 0.40 h/day, p = 0.01), while no between group differences were observed for LPA and MPA (p>0.05). Bivariate analysis showed that higher NPA was associated with fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale, FSS score) in PwMS with EDSS 0-1.5 (r = 0.34, p = 0.05). In PwMS with EDSS 2-2.5, NPA was correlated with Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT, r=-0.45, p = 0.02) and CIQ (r=-0.41, p = 0.04), while VPA was more associated with FSS (R= -0.38, p = 0.06).The PA level of PwMS differs from that of healthy subjects even in early diagnosed subjects. In PwMS with EDSS 0-1.5 only, fatigue is associated to prolonged inactive behavior. Conversely, in PwMS with EDSS 2-2.5 both inactivity and vigorous activities are modulated by fatigue, endurance and associated with different level of social participation.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4303685907","numberInSourceReferences":284,"doi":"10.3390/IJERPH191912466","title":"Sedentary Behavior and Lower-Extremity Physical Function across the Lifespan of Adults with Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Brenda Jeng","orcid":"0000-0002-4522-1523","LN":"Jeng","FN":"Brenda","affil":"University of Illinois at Chicago (US)","name":"Brenda Jeng"},{"id":"Petra Šilić","orcid":"0000-0002-2807-0663","LN":"Šilić","FN":"Petra","name":"Petra Šilić"},{"id":"Trinh Huynh","orcid":null,"LN":"Huynh","FN":"Trinh","name":"Trinh Huynh"},{"id":"Robert W.

This study examined the associations between device-measured volume and pattern of sedentary behavior and physical function based on SPPB (Short Physical Performance Battery) of ambulatory persons with MS across the lifespan.

Participants completed the SPPB during a single visit to the laboratory and wore an accelerometer for a 7-day period. The one-way analysis of variance indicated no differences in volume and pattern of sedentary behavior among the three age groups, except for average sedentary bout length. Spearman bivariate correlations indicated that pattern, but not volume, of sedentary behavior was associated with physical function in young, middle-aged, and older adults, and the magnitude of these associations varied by age group. Future interventions may reduce and break up prolonged periods of sedentary behavior for improvements in physical function and possibly other consequences in persons with MS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4307839780","numberInSourceReferences":287,"doi":"10.1177/15459683221131787","title":"Moderate-to-Vigorous Physical Activity is Related With Retinal Neuronal and Axonal Integrity in Persons With Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Jeongwoon Kim","orcid":"0000-0002-7102-6799","LN":"Kim","FN":"Jeongwoon","affil":"University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (US)","name":"Jeongwoon Kim"},{"id":"Rachel E.

The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and the Incidental and Planned Exercise Questionnaire (IPEQ) have been widely used, but their validity has not been investigated previously in PwMS. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the convergent and criterion validity of the IPAQ and the IPEQ in PwMS. METHODS: 50 PwMS were asked to wear an Actigraph for seven days and to fill the IPAQ and IPEQ. Sedentary, moderate (MPA), vigorous (VPA) and moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) levels were recorded. RESULTS: Significant correlations were found between sitting time as reported by IPAQ and sedentary time as recorded by Actigraph (r = 0.41, p = 0.003), VPA by IPAQ and VPA as recorded by Actigraph (r = 0.46, p = 0.001), and MVPA by IPAQ and MVPA by Actigraph (r = 0.36, p = 0.011). IPEQ showed poor both criterion and convergent validity when compared to the Actigraph. Both IPAQ and IPEQ overestimate the intensities of PA for all the derived parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Findings of this study are important as they suggest that IPAQ in particular had convergent validity when compared to Actigraph data, but still had the problem of overestimating PA levels.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3197481331","numberInSourceReferences":257,"doi":"10.3390/S21175806","title":"A Preliminary Investigation of the Effects of Obstacle Negotiation and Turning on Gait Variability in Adults with Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Lara Weed","orcid":null,"LN":"Weed","FN":"Lara","affil":"University of Vermont (US)","name":"Lara Weed"},{"id":"Casey Little","orcid":null,"LN":"Little","FN":"Casey","affil":"University of Vermont (US)","name":"Casey Little"},{"id":"Susan L.

While increased gait variability is a robust biomarker of fall risk in PwMS, gait variability in more ecologically related tasks is unclear. Here, the effects of turning and negotiating an obstacle on gait variability in PwMS were investigated. PwMS and matched healthy controls were instrumented with inertial measurement units on the feet, lumbar, and torso. Subjects completed a walk and turn (WT) with and without an obstacle crossing (OW). Each task was partitioned into pre-turn, post-turn, pre-obstacle, and post-obstacle phases for analysis. Spatial and temporal gait measures and measures of trunk rotation were captured for each phase of each task. In the WT condition, PwMS demonstrated significantly more variability in lumbar and trunk yaw range of motion and rate, lateral foot deviation, cadence, and step time after turning than before. In the OW condition, PwMS demonstrated significantly more variability in both spatial and temporal gait parameters in obstacle approach after turning compared to before turning. No significant differences in gait variability were observed after negotiating an obstacle, regardless of turning or not. Results suggest that the context of gait variability measurement is important. The increased number of variables impacted from turning and the influence of turning on obstacle negotiation suggest that varying tasks must be considered together rather than in isolation to obtain an informed understanding of gait variability that more closely resembles everyday walking.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2999919444","numberInSourceReferences":184,"doi":"10.1016/J.MSARD.2020.101941","title":"Physical activity and peak oxygen consumption are associated with walking in multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Brooks A.

MS results in declines in physical activity and peak oxygen consumption that might be independently associated with declines in walking performance. Therefore our purpose was to evaluate the association between physical activity and peak oxygen consumption with walking performance in individuals with MS. Methods Fifty individuals with MS between the ages of 18–70 yrs. (Female: 38; 46 ± 12 yrs.; BMI: 28.5 ± 6.4; EDSS: 3.3 [IQR: 2.5–4]) performed a maximal incremental cycle test to assess peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak), and wore an accelerometer for one week to measure moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Subjects further completed a timed 25-foot walk test (T25FW) and 6-minute walk (6MW) to measure walking performance. Results MVPA and VO2peak were correlated with 6MW and T25FW (p < 0.05). When combined in multivariate regression analyses, VO2peak and MVPA were both significant contributors of T25FW speed and 6MW, but after controlling for sex and age, MVPA was the only significant contributor (β = 0.32 and β = 0.44, respectively). Conclusion Both higher MVPA and VO2peak were associated with better walking performance and in a combined model physical activity, but not peak oxygen consumption, remained an independent contributor to walking performance in individuals with MS. These results suggest that improving MVPA is a potential target for interventions to improve walking performance in persons with MS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4298087759","numberInSourceReferences":260,"doi":"10.1177/13524585221124043","title":"The mSteps pilot study: Analysis of the distance walked using a novel smartphone application in multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Sarah Alexander","orcid":"0000-0002-3680-1120","LN":"Alexander","FN":"Sarah","affil":"Queen Mary University of London (GB), University College London (GB), National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery (GB)","name":"Sarah Alexander"},{"id":"Marie Braisher","orcid":"0000-0003-0634-8350","LN":"Braisher","FN":"Marie","affil":"Queen Mary University of London (GB), University College London (GB), National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery (GB)","name":"Marie Braisher"},{"id":"Carmen Tur","orcid":null,"LN":"Tur","FN":"Carmen","affil":"Queen Mary University of London (GB), University College London (GB), National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery (GB)","name":"Carmen Tur"},{"id":"Jeremy Chataway","orcid":null,"LN":"Chataway","FN":"Jeremy","affil":"University College London (GB), National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery (GB), National Institute for Health Research (GB)","name":"Jeremy Chataway"}],"year":2022,"journal":"Multiple Sclerosis Journal","references":["W1999839412","W2015795623","W2038950641","W2059449425","W2067060782","W2105206040","W2110071287","W2110108424","W2112165124","W2148101338","W2321149532","W2351406992","W2557274736","W2586302922","W2765429604","W2777074421","W3047026678","W4249810852"],"citationsCount":0,"abstract":"Clinical studies in multiple sclerosis (MS) often require accurate measurement of walking distance.

To do so, standard gait features can be used but they fail to detect subtle changes in several pathologies including multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system whose symptoms include lower limb impairment, which is why gait trials are commonly used by clinicians for their patients' follow-up. This article describes a method to compare pairs of gait signals, visualize the results and interpret them, based on topological data analysis techniques. Our method is non-parametric and requires no data other than gait signals acquired with inertial measurement units. We introduce tools from topological data analysis (sublevel sets, persistence barcodes) in a practical way to make it as accessible as possible in order to encourage its use by clinicians. We apply our method to study a cohort of patients suffering from progressive multiple sclerosis and healthy subjects. We show that it can help estimate the severity of the disease and also be used for longitudinal follow-up to detect an evolution of the disease or other phenomena such as asymmetry or outliers.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4308780422","numberInSourceReferences":299,"doi":"10.1016/J.CLINBIOMECH.2022.105818","title":"Spatiotemporal gait changes in people with multiple sclerosis with different disease progression subtypes","authors":[{"id":"Sumire Sato","orcid":null,"LN":"Sato","FN":"Sumire","affil":"University of Massachusetts Amherst (US), University of Florida (US)","name":"Sumire Sato"},{"id":"Yeun Hiroi","orcid":null,"LN":"Hiroi","FN":"Yeun","name":"Yeun Hiroi"},{"id":"Danielle Zoppo","orcid":null,"LN":"Zoppo","FN":"Danielle","name":"Danielle Zoppo"},{"id":"John P.

The objective here was to examine differences in spatiotemporal gait in MS and between relapsing-remitting and progressive subtypes during the timed-25-ft-walk test. Our specific aims were to investigate (1) spatiotemporal, (2) spatiotemporal variability<i>,</i> and (3) gait modulation differences between healthy controls and MS subtypes at preferred and fast walking speed. <h3>Methods</h3> This study included 27 controls, 18 relapsing-remitting MS, and 13 progressive MS participants. Participants wore six inertial sensors and walked overground without walking aids at preferred and fast-as-possible speeds. <h3>Findings</h3> Both MS groups had significantly lower walking speed than controls, with a trend towards lower preferred gait speed in progressive compared to relapsing-remitting MS (ES = 0.502). Although most spatiotemporal gait parameters differed between controls and MS groups, differences were not significant between MS subtypes in these parameters and their variability, with low to moderate effect sizes during preferred and fast walking. Both MS groups showed reduced modulation in gait compared to controls and no significant differences between MS subtypes. <h3>Interpretation</h3> Gait in MS is altered compared to controls. Although gait may change with progressive MS, the overall small differences in the gait parameters between the MS subtypes observed in this sample suggests that those with the progressive form of MS who are independently ambulatory and without further clinically meaningful changes in gait speed may not show gait decrements greater than the relapsing-remitting form of the disease.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3166757737","numberInSourceReferences":244,"doi":"10.1016/J.MSARD.2021.103081","title":"Use of wrist-worn accelerometers to quantify bilateral upper limb activity and asymmetry under free-living conditions in people with multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Massimiliano Pau","orcid":"0000-0001-9835-3629","LN":"Pau","FN":"Massimiliano","affil":"University of Cagliari (IT)","name":"Massimiliano Pau"},{"id":"Bruno Leban","orcid":null,"LN":"Leban","FN":"Bruno","affil":"University of Cagliari (IT)","name":"Bruno Leban"},{"id":"Michela Deidda","orcid":"0000-0003-3573-2992","LN":"Deidda","FN":"Michela","affil":"University of Cagliari (IT)","name":"Michela Deidda"},{"id":"Micaela Porta","orcid":"0000-0003-3835-6507","LN":"Porta","FN":"Micaela","affil":"University of Cagliari (IT)","name":"Micaela Porta"},{"id":"Giancarlo Coghe","orcid":null,"LN":"Coghe","FN":"Giancarlo","affil":"University of Cagliari (IT)","name":"Giancarlo Coghe"},{"id":"Davide Cattaneo","orcid":null,"LN":"Cattaneo","FN":"Davide","affil":"Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation (IT), University of Milan (IT)","name":"Davide Cattaneo"},{"id":"Eleonora Cocco","orcid":null,"LN":"Cocco","FN":"Eleonora","affil":"University of Cagliari (IT)","name":"Eleonora Cocco"}],"year":2021,"journal":"Multiple sclerosis and related disorders","references":["W1752985724","W1999586653","W2039599652","W2057238715","W2057980146","W2098421679","W2104262787","W2106875358","W2122401765","W2122545833","W2154719837","W2155058845","W2211696483","W2342870422","W2514505354","W2589005373","W2597188996","W2601739572","W2756570429","W2789894786","W2793993706","W2883558321","W2916040650","W2937440369","W2941139038","W3023064862","W3038516209","W3108972543","W3147819615"],"citationsCount":3,"abstract":"<h2>Abstract</h2> Background: Although upper limb (UL) dysfunctions are quite common among people with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS), there is a scarcity of information about actual UL usage under free-living conditions. The aim of the present study is to quantitatively assess ‘real-world' activity time, intensity and possible asymmetry of use among dominant and non-dominant ULs in pwMS. Methods: Twenty-eight pwMS (20 women, 8 men, average EDSS 4.3) and 28 age- and sex-matched unaffected individuals were required to wear a tri-axial accelerometer on each wrist 24h/day for 2 weekdays. Raw accelerations were processed to calculate parameters associated with time and intensity of use of UL both when engaged in uni- or bilateral activities. Results: During the 2-day monitoring period, pwMS were characterized by significantly lower overall activity, they used their dominant limb for a significantly longer time and, while performing bilateral activities, their dominant limb expressed movements of superior intensity in a proportion higher than what was observed in unaffected individuals. Conclusion: The instrumental monitoring of UL activity with two wrist-worn sensors may represent an effective tool for assessing the contribution of each limb to uni- and bilateral movements. Such data can be employed to monitor the progression of UL dysfunctions and the effectiveness of pharmacologic and rehabilitative treatments.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3211903339","numberInSourceReferences":254,"doi":"10.3390/BRAINSCI11111507","title":"Automated Analysis of the Two-Minute Walk Test in Clinical Practice Using Accelerometer Data","authors":[{"id":"Katrin Trentzsch","orcid":"0000-0003-2832-4640","LN":"Trentzsch","FN":"Katrin","affil":"University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus (DE), TU Dresden (DE)","name":"Katrin Trentzsch"},{"id":"Benjamin Melzer","orcid":null,"LN":"Melzer","FN":"Benjamin","affil":"TU Dresden (DE)","name":"Benjamin Melzer"},{"id":"Heidi Stölzer-Hutsch","orcid":null,"LN":"Stölzer-Hutsch","FN":"Heidi","affil":"University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus (DE), TU Dresden (DE)","name":"Heidi Stölzer-Hutsch"},{"id":"Rocco Haase","orcid":"0000-0003-2465-4909","LN":"Haase","FN":"Rocco","affil":"University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus (DE), TU Dresden (DE)","name":"Rocco Haase"},{"id":"Paul Bartscht","orcid":null,"LN":"Bartscht","FN":"Paul","affil":"University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus (DE), TU Dresden (DE)","name":"Paul Bartscht"},{"id":"Paul Meyer","orcid":null,"LN":"Meyer","FN":"Paul","affil":"TU Dresden (DE)","name":"Paul Meyer"},{"id":"Tjalf Ziemssen","orcid":null,"LN":"Ziemssen","FN":"Tjalf","affil":"University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus (DE), TU Dresden (DE)","name":"Tjalf Ziemssen"}],"year":2021,"journal":"Brain Sciences","references":["W1967990636","W1971834822","W2001818617","W2006331513","W2035541251","W2056427752","W2067428313","W2078220707","W2090718971","W2092932765","W2093375256","W2093612473","W2107596010","W2110585947","W2112104974","W2112374874","W2119408292","W2121149730","W2154356205","W2156441323","W2280304830","W2313125888","W2327037637","W2416440676","W2489222638","W2580134956","W2606165363","W2755715597","W2789259524","W2789512084","W2793353546","W2888494644","W2913609757","W2953312248","W2982007670","W3019558441","W3021823648","W3030156391","W3081845296","W3095335580","W3106819768","W3109545180","W3129040874","W3159064895","W3173100152","W3192814328","W4249602077","W4292679678"],"citationsCount":2,"abstract":"One of the core problems for people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) is the impairment of their ability to walk, which can be severely restrictive in everyday life. Therefore, monitoring of ambulatory function is of great importance to be able to effectively counteract disease progression. An extensive gait analysis, such as the Dresden protocol for multidimensional walking assessment, covers several facets of walking impairment including a 2-min walk test, in which the distance taken by the patient in two minutes is measured by an odometer. Using this approach, it is questionable how precise the measuring methods are at recording the distance traveled. In this project, we investigate whether the current measurement can be replaced by a digital measurement method based on accelerometers (six Opal sensors from the Mobility Lab system) that are attached to the patient's body. We developed two algorithms using these data and compared the validity of these approaches using the results from 2-min walk tests from 562 pwMS that were collected with a gold-standard odometer. In 48.4% of pwMS, we detected an average relative measurement error of less than 5%, while results from 25.8% of the pwMS showed a relative measurement error of up to 10%. The algorithm had difficulties correctly calculating the walking distances in another 25.8% of pwMS; these results showed a measurement error of more than 20%. A main reason for this moderate performance was the variety of pathologically altered gait patterns in pwMS that may complicate the step detection. Overall, both algorithms achieved favorable levels of agreement (r = 0.884 and r = 0.980) with the odometer. Finally, we present suggestions for improvement of the measurement system to be implemented in the future.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2179488881","numberInSourceReferences":112,"doi":"10.7224/1537-2073.2015-035","title":"A Randomized Crossover Trial of Dalfampridine Extended Release for Effect on Ambulatory Activity in People with Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Theodore L.

This study assessed the effects of D-ER on accelerometer-based measures in people with MS, including intensity of walking and total amount of walking during daily activities. Methods: In this double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study, people with MS-related walking difficulty were randomized (1:1) to receive 4 weeks of D-ER 10 mg twice daily and 4 weeks of placebo in either order separated by a 2-week washout. Participants wore accelerometers for 7 days at baseline and week 3 of each on-drug period. The primary outcome was the peak activity index (PAI), defined as the most intense 30 individual minutes of the day (strides per minute). Secondary outcomes included daily step count, 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, and patient-reported outcomes. A mixed-effects repeated-measures statistical model was used. Results: Forty-three participants were randomized (mean Expanded Disability Status Scale score, 5.17). Least squares mean (standard error) change from baseline on the PAI was 0.6 (0.54) strides/min on D-ER and 0.3 (0.55) strides/min on placebo and in daily step count was 148.7 (222.4) on D-ER and 128.0 (225.4) on placebo. Other accelerometer-based measures and the 6MWT showed no significant differences between D-ER and placebo. The TUG test (P = .042) favored D-ER. There were no serious adverse events. Conclusions: Dalfampridine did not show an effect on accelerometer-measured ambulatory activity in people with MS-related walking difficulty. More work is needed to confirm these results.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2058808787","numberInSourceReferences":37,"doi":"10.7224/1537-2073-13.4.170","title":"The Impact of Gait Disability on the Calibration of Accelerometer Output in Adults with Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Madeline Weikert","orcid":null,"LN":"Weikert","FN":"Madeline","affil":"University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (US)","name":"Madeline Weikert"},{"id":"Deirdre Dlugonski","orcid":null,"LN":"Dlugonski","FN":"Deirdre","affil":"University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (US)","name":"Deirdre Dlugonski"},{"id":"Yoojin Suh","orcid":null,"LN":"Suh","FN":"Yoojin","affil":"University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (US)","name":"Yoojin Suh"},{"id":"Bo Fernhall","orcid":null,"LN":"Fernhall","FN":"Bo","affil":"University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (US)","name":"Bo Fernhall"},{"id":"Robert W.

This study examined the effects of gait disability on 1) the association between rates of energy expenditure and accelerometer output in overground walking and 2) the calibration of accelerometer output for quantifying time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in people with MS. The sample consisted of 24 individuals with MS, of whom 10 reported gait disability based on Patient-Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) scores. The participants undertook three 6-minute periods of overground walking while wearing an accelerometer and a portable metabolic unit (K4b2, Cosmed, Rome, Italy). In the first period of walking, the participants walked at a self-selected, comfortable speed. In the two subsequent walking periods, participants walked at speeds above and below (±0.5 mph) the comfortable walking speed, respectively. Strong linear relationships were observed between rates of accelerometer activity counts and energy expenditure during walking in the overall sample (R2 = 0.90) and subsamples with (R2 = 0.88) and without gait disability (R2 = 0.91). The slope of the relationship was significantly steeper in the subsample with gait disability (β= 0.0049) than in the subsample without gait disability (β= 0.0026). The difference in slopes resulted in a significantly lower cut-point for MVPA (1886 vs. 2717 counts/min) in those with gait disability. These findings provide a metabolic cut-point for quantifying time spent in MVPA in people with MS, both with and without gait disability.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4285609904","numberInSourceReferences":270,"doi":"10.2196/38495","title":"Predicting Multiple Sclerosis Outcomes During the COVID-19 Stay-at-home Period: Observational Study Using Passively Sensed Behaviors and Digital Phenotyping","authors":[{"id":"Prerna Chikersal","orcid":"0000-0002-0961-6210","LN":"Chikersal","FN":"Prerna","affil":"Carnegie Mellon University (US)","name":"Prerna Chikersal"},{"id":"Shruthi Venkatesh","orcid":null,"LN":"Venkatesh","FN":"Shruthi","affil":"University of Pittsburgh (US)","name":"Shruthi Venkatesh"},{"id":"Karmen Masown","orcid":null,"LN":"Masown","FN":"Karmen","affil":"University of Pittsburgh (US)","name":"Karmen Masown"},{"id":"Elizabeth A.

Spatial (trace accuracy), temporal (mean and variability in linear, angular, and radial drawing velocities, and dwell time ratio), and spatiotemporal features (trace celerity) were cross-sectionally analyzed for correlation with standard clinical and brain magnetic resonance imaging (normalized brain volume and total lesion volume) disease burden measures, and for capacity to differentiate people with multiple sclerosis from healthy controls.Data from 69 people with multiple sclerosis and 18 healthy controls were analyzed. Trace accuracy (all shapes), linear velocity variability (circle, figure-of-8, spiral shapes), and radial velocity variability (spiral shape) had a mostly fair/moderate-to-good correlation (|r| = 0.14-0.66) with all disease burden measures. Trace celerity also had mostly fair/moderate-to-good correlation (|r| = 0.18-0.41) with Nine-Hole Peg Test performance, cerebellar functional system score, and brain magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, partial correlation analysis related these results to motor impairment. People with multiple sclerosis showed greater drawing velocity variability, though slower mean velocity, than healthy controls.

METHODS Patients with MS were followed prospectively during routine clinic visits approximately every 6 months. At each visit, participants performed finger and foot taps wearing the MYO-band, which includes accelerometer, gyroscope, and surface electromyogram sensors. Metrics of within-patient limb progression were created by combining the change in signal waveform features over time. The resulting upper (UE) and lower (LE) extremity metrics' discrimination of progressive versus relapsing MS were evaluated with calculation of AUROC. Comparisons with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores were made with Pearson correlation. RESULTS Participants included 53 relapsing and 15 progressive MS (72% female, baseline mean age 48 years, median disease duration 11 years, median EDSS 2.5, median 10 months follow-up). The final summary metrics differentiated relapsing from secondary progressive MS with AUROC UE 0.93 and LE 0.96. The metrics were associated with baseline EDSS (UE P = 0.0003, LE P = 0.0007). While most had no change in EDSS during the short follow-up, several had evidence of progression by the multisensor metrics. INTERPRETATION Within a short follow-up interval, this novel multisensor algorithm distinguished progressive from relapsing MS and captured changes in limb function. Inexpensive, noninvasive and easy to use, this novel outcome is readily adaptable to clinical practice and trials as a MS vital sign. This approach also holds promise to monitor limb dysfunction in other neurological diseases.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3216510562","numberInSourceReferences":240,"doi":"10.1177/20552173211057514","title":"Cardiorespiratory fitness and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in older adults with multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Robert W.

The purpose of this study was to determine how relationships between trunk and foot acceleration variability relate to physiological impairments, clinical disability scales, and mobility questionnaires in persons with multiple sclerosis.  Methods 15 fallers and 25 non-fallers with multiple sclerosis walked on a treadmill at normal walking speed while trunk and foot accelerations were recorded with wireless accelerometers and variability measures were extracted and used to calculate the gait stability index metrics as a ratio of trunk acceleration variability divided foot acceleration variability. Subjects' sensorimotor delays and lower extremity vibration sensitivity were tested. Subjects also completed clinical disability scales (Guy's Neurological Disability Scale and Patient Reported Expanded Disability Status Scale) and mobility questionnaires (Falls Efficacy Scale, Activities Balance Confidence Scale, 12 Item Multiple Sclerosis Walk Scale).  Findings Multiple gait stability index metrics were significantly correlated with clinical measures of disability and mobility in multiple sclerosis subjects (r = 0.354–0.528), but no correlations were found for sensorimotor delays or lower extremity sensation. Multiple gait stability indices performed at least as well as clinical questionnaires for separating fallers from non-fallers.  Interpretation The gait stability indices can potentially be used outside of a laboratory setting to measure walking characteristics related to fall history and disability level in people with multiple sclerosis.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4292354392","numberInSourceReferences":266,"doi":"10.1212/WNL.0000000000201098","title":"Six-Minute Walk as a Measure of Walking Capacity and Endurance in Patients With Pediatric-Onset Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"James D.

The contribution of walking capacity, endurance, behavior, and MS co-morbidities remain relatively undefined and may provide valuable insights into the limitations toward physical activity in youth with MS. OBJECTIVE: Investigate differences in walking capacity, endurance and real-world behaviors of daily activity between youth with POMS and controls. DESIGN/METHODS : Youth diagnosed with MS prior to 18 years and aged ≤21 years were recruited in addition to healthy controls. Subjects completed questionnaires to quantify fatigue, depression, and physical activity levels and the timed 2- and 6-minute walk (2MW, 6MW) as an assessment of walk capacity and endurance. Subjects were sent home with a waist-worn accelerometer to assess real-world walking behavior. RESULTS: Forty-five POMS and 85 control subjects were enrolled. The POMS cohort had a mean age of 16.9±2.7 years with a mean disease duration of 2.8±2.6 years. A greater proportion of the POMS cohort was overweight/obese compared to controls (60% versus 33%). Subjects with MS walked a significantly shorter distance in 6 minutes compared to controls (1848 feet vs 2134 feet, p&lt;0.0001) and, unlike controls, were unable to accelerate to their peak speed at the end of the 6MW. BMI category and MS disease significantly impacted 6MW performance. Using continuous accelerometry, subjects with MS spent less time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity compared to controls (20.4 minutes/day vs 35.4 minutes/day, p=0.0003). The POMS cohort reported significantly higher levels of depression and fatigue, but self-reported similar levels of daily physical activity as controls. CONCLUSIONS: Youth with POMS exhibit slower 6MW performance and less daily engagement in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, suggesting limitations in functional walking capacity, endurance, and daily activity behavior. Limitations in walking endurance and capacity are most prominent in those youth who are overweight/obese and living with MS. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that, compared to healthy controls, patients with pediatric-onset MS walk shorter distances on the 6 minute walk test, are less able to accelerate to peak speed at the end of the test, and are less physically active.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4220704146","numberInSourceReferences":280,"doi":"10.1016/J.DHJO.2022.101314","title":"Physical activity and vascular comorbidity in Black and White persons with multiple sclerosis: A cross-sectional study","authors":[{"id":"Trinh Huynh","orcid":null,"LN":"Huynh","FN":"Trinh","affil":"University of Alabama at Birmingham (US)","name":"Trinh Huynh"},{"id":"Brenda Jeng","orcid":"0000-0002-4522-1523","LN":"Jeng","FN":"Brenda","affil":"University of Alabama at Birmingham (US)","name":"Brenda Jeng"},{"id":"Robert W.

Fatigue is among the most common symptoms in MS, resulting in reduced mobility and quality of life. The six-minute walking test (6MWT) is commonly used as a measure of fatigability for the assessment of state fatigue throughout treatment or rehabilitation programs. This 'gold standard' test is time-consuming and can be difficult and exhausting for some patients with high levels of disability or high rates of fatigue.Can short inertial sensor-based gait tests assess perceived state fatigue in MS patients?Sixty-five MS patients equipped with one sensor on each foot performed the 6 min walk test (6MWT) and the 25-foot walk (25FW, at both preferred and fastest speed). Perceived state fatigue was measured after each minute of the 6MWT, using the Borg rating. The highest of these ratings served as a measure of overall perceived state fatigue. Stride-wise spatio-temporal gait parameters were extracted from the 25FW and from the first minute, first 2 min, and first 4 min of the 6MWT. Principal component analysis was performed. Perceived state fatigue was predicted in a regression analysis, using the principal components of gait parameters as predictors. Statistical tests evaluated differences in performance between the full 6MWT, the shortened 6MWT, and the 25FW.A mean absolute error of less than 2 points on the Borg rating was obtained using the shortened 6MWT and the 25FW. There were no significant differences between the prediction accuracy of the full 6MWT and that of the shortened gait tests.It is possible to use shortened gait tests when evaluating perceived state fatigue in MS patients using inertial sensors. Substituting them for long gait tests may reduce the burden of the testing on both patients and clinicians. Further, the approach taken here may prompt future work to explore the use of short bouts of real-world walking with unobtrusive inertial sensors for state fatigue assessment.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4308434695","numberInSourceReferences":289,"doi":"10.2196/37614","title":"The Use of Smartphone Keystroke Dynamics to Passively Monitor Upper Limb and Cognitive Function in Multiple Sclerosis: Longitudinal Analysis","authors":[{"id":"K.Y.

Analysis of keyboard interactions during regular typing, that is, keystroke dynamics, could therefore potentially be utilized for passive and continuous monitoring of function in patients with multiple sclerosis.To determine whether passively acquired smartphone keystroke dynamics correspond to multiple sclerosis outcomes, we investigated the association between keystroke dynamics and clinical outcomes (upper limb and cognitive function). This association was investigated longitudinally in order to study within-patient changes independently of between-patient differences.During a 1-year follow-up, arm function and information processing speed were assessed every 3 months in 102 patients with multiple sclerosis with the Nine-Hole Peg Test and Symbol Digit Modalities Test, respectively. Keystroke-dynamics data were continuously obtained from regular typing on the participants' own smartphones. Press-and-release latency of the alphanumeric keys constituted the fine motor score cluster, while latency of the punctuation and backspace keys constituted the cognition score cluster. The association over time between keystroke clusters and the corresponding clinical outcomes was assessed with linear mixed models with subjects as random intercepts. By centering around the mean and calculating deviation scores within subjects, between-subject and within-subject effects were distinguished.Mean (SD) scores for the fine motor score cluster and cognition score cluster were 0.43 (0.16) and 0.94 (0.41) seconds, respectively. The fine motor score cluster was significantly associated with the Nine-Hole Peg Test: between-subject β was 15.9 (95% CI 12.2-19.6) and within-subject β was 6.9 (95% CI 2.0-11.9). The cognition score cluster was significantly associated with the Symbol Digit Modalities Test between subjects (between-subject β -11.2, 95% CI -17.3 to -5.2) but not within subjects (within-subject β -0.4, 95% CI -5.6 to 4.9).Smartphone keystroke dynamics were longitudinally associated with multiple sclerosis outcomes. Worse arm function corresponded with longer latency in typing both across and within patients. Worse processing speed corresponded with higher latency in using punctuation and backspace keys across subjects. Hence, keystroke dynamics are a potential digital biomarker for remote monitoring and predicting clinical outcomes in patients with multiple sclerosis.Netherlands Trial Register NTR7268; https://trialsearch.who.int/Trial2.aspx?TrialID=NTR7268.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4313010655","numberInSourceReferences":290,"doi":"10.1007/978-981-19-8234-7_20","title":"Machine Learning to Diagnose Neurodegenerative Multiple Sclerosis Disease","authors":[{"id":"Jin Si Lam","orcid":null,"LN":"Lam","FN":"Jin Si","name":"Jin Si Lam"},{"id":"Md.

However, single variable weights have not yet been adequately assessed. Hence, the aim of this pilot randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the tDCS effects on balance and gait in patients with MS through a machine learning approach. In this pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT), we included people with relapsing−remitting MS and an Expanded Disability Status Scale >1 and <5 that were randomly allocated to two groups—a study group, undergoing a 10-session anodal motor cortex tDCS, and a control group, undergoing a sham treatment. Both groups underwent a specific balance and gait rehabilitative program. We assessed as outcome measures the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Fall Risk Index and timed up-and-go and 6-min-walking tests at baseline (T0), the end of intervention (T1) and 4 (T2) and 6 weeks after the intervention (T3) with an inertial motion unit. At each time point, we performed a multiple factor analysis through a machine learning approach to allow the analysis of the influence of the balance and gait variables, grouping the participants based on the results. Seventeen MS patients (aged 40.6 ± 14.4 years), 9 in the study group and 8 in the sham group, were included. We reported a significant repeated measures difference between groups for distances covered (6MWT (meters), p < 0.03). At T1, we showed a significant increase in distance (m) with a mean difference (MD) of 37.0 [−59.0, 17.0] (p = 0.003), and in BBS with a MD of 2.0 [−4.0, 3.0] (p = 0.03). At T2, these improvements did not seem to be significantly maintained; however, considering the machine learning analysis, the Silhouette Index of 0.34, with a low cluster overlap trend, confirmed the possible short-term effects (T2), even at 6 weeks. Therefore, this pilot RCT showed that tDCS may provide non-sustained improvements in gait and balance in MS patients. In this scenario, machine learning could suggest evidence of prolonged beneficial effects.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4307903942","numberInSourceReferences":303,"doi":"10.1016/J.CMPB.2022.107204","title":"The utility of wearable devices in assessing ambulatory impairments of people with multiple sclerosis in free-living conditions","authors":[{"id":"Shaoxiong Sun","orcid":"0000-0003-3652-5266","LN":"Sun","FN":"Shaoxiong","affil":"King's College London (GB)","name":"Shaoxiong Sun"},{"id":"Amos A Folarin","orcid":null,"LN":"Folarin","FN":"Amos A","name":"Amos A Folarin"},{"id":"Yuezhou Zhang","orcid":"0000-0003-4817-3835","LN":"Zhang","FN":"Yuezhou","name":"Yuezhou Zhang"},{"id":"Nicholas Cummins","orcid":"0000-0002-1178-917X","LN":"Cummins","FN":"Nicholas","name":"Nicholas Cummins"},{"id":"Shuo Liu","orcid":"0000-0001-8133-8588","LN":"Liu","FN":"Shuo","name":"Shuo Liu"},{"id":"Callum Stewart","orcid":null,"LN":"Stewart","FN":"Callum","name":"Callum Stewart"},{"id":"Yatharth Ranjan","orcid":"0000-0003-3079-3120","LN":"Ranjan","FN":"Yatharth","name":"Yatharth Ranjan"},{"id":"Zulqarnain Rashid","orcid":null,"LN":"Rashid","FN":"Zulqarnain","name":"Zulqarnain Rashid"},{"id":"Pauline Conde","orcid":"0000-0003-0513-0915","LN":"Conde","FN":"Pauline","name":"Pauline Conde"},{"id":"Petroula Laiou","orcid":"0000-0002-5798-6961","LN":"Laiou","FN":"Petroula","name":"Petroula Laiou"},{"id":"Heet Sankesara","orcid":"0000-0002-9126-5615","LN":"Sankesara","FN":"Heet","name":"Heet Sankesara"},{"id":"Gloria Dalla Costa","orcid":"0000-0002-8761-9337","LN":"Costa","FN":"Gloria Dalla","name":"Gloria Dalla Costa"},{"id":"Letizia Leocani","orcid":null,"LN":"Leocani","FN":"Letizia","name":"Letizia Leocani"},{"id":"Per Soelberg Sørensen","orcid":null,"LN":"Sørensen","FN":"Per Soelberg","name":"Per Soelberg Sørensen"},{"id":"Melinda Magyari","orcid":"0000-0002-0972-5222","LN":"Magyari","FN":"Melinda","name":"Melinda Magyari"},{"id":"Ana Guerrero","orcid":null,"LN":"Guerrero","FN":"Ana","name":"Ana Guerrero"},{"id":"Ana Zabalza","orcid":null,"LN":"Zabalza","FN":"Ana","name":"Ana Zabalza"},{"id":"Srinivasan Vairavan","orcid":null,"LN":"Vairavan","FN":"Srinivasan","name":"Srinivasan Vairavan"},{"id":"Raquel Bailon","orcid":null,"LN":"Bailon","FN":"Raquel","name":"Raquel Bailon"},{"id":"Sara Simblett","orcid":null,"LN":"Simblett","FN":"Sara","name":"Sara Simblett"},{"id":"Inez Myin-Germeys","orcid":"0000-0002-3731-4930","LN":"Myin-Germeys","FN":"Inez","name":"Inez Myin-Germeys"},{"id":"Aki Rintala","orcid":"0000-0002-0066-4697","LN":"Rintala","FN":"Aki","name":"Aki Rintala"},{"id":"Til Wykes","orcid":"0000-0002-5881-8003","LN":"Wykes","FN":"Til","name":"Til Wykes"},{"id":"Vaibhav A Narayan","orcid":null,"LN":"Narayan","FN":"Vaibhav A","name":"Vaibhav A Narayan"},{"id":"Matthew Hotopf","orcid":null,"LN":"Hotopf","FN":"Matthew","name":"Matthew Hotopf"},{"id":"Giancarlo Comi","orcid":null,"LN":"Comi","FN":"Giancarlo","name":"Giancarlo Comi"},{"id":"Richard Dobson","orcid":null,"LN":"Dobson","FN":"Richard","name":"Richard Dobson"}],"year":2022,"journal":"Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine","references":["W1678356000","W1967990636","W1971992625","W1995110505","W2007757525","W2051274614","W2067885332","W2093274439","W2095310389","W2103758700","W2106412194","W2112165124","W2113175552","W2121149730","W2122825543","W2131605908","W2141062585","W2161512391","W2196551647","W2404519457","W2557274736","W2588488142","W2755715597","W2766333804","W2883576155","W2904206377","W2905560890","W2912143189","W2921754847","W3041505820","W3047026678","W3089922264","W3105534656","W3126649157","W3161114805","W3193647787"],"citationsCount":0,"abstract":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system affecting over 2.5 million people globally. In-clinic six-minute walk test (6MWT) is a widely used objective measure to evaluate the progression of MS. Yet, it has limitations such as the need for a clinical visit and a proper walkway. The widespread use of wearable devices capable of depicting patients' activity profiles has the potential to assess the level of MS-induced disability in free-living conditions.In this work, we extracted 96 features in different temporal granularities (from minute-level to day-level) from wearable data and explored their utility in estimating 6MWT scores in a European (Italy, Spain, and Denmark) MS cohort of 337 participants over an average of 10 months' duration. We combined these features with participants' demographics using three regression models including elastic net, gradient boosted trees and random forest. In addition, we quantified the individual feature's contribution using feature importance in these regression models, linear mixed-effects models, generalized estimating equations, and correlation-based feature selection (CFS).The results showed promising estimation performance with R2 of 0.30, which was derived using random forest after CFS. This model was able to distinguish the participants with low disability from those with high disability. Furthermore, we observed that the minute-level (≤ 8 minutes) step count, particularly those capturing the upper end of the step count distribution, had a stronger association with 6MWT. The use of a walking aid was indicative of ambulatory function measured through 6MWT.This study demonstrates the utility of wearables devices in assessing ambulatory impairments in people with MS in free-living conditions and provides a basis for future investigation into the clinical relevance.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3093257741","numberInSourceReferences":181,"doi":"10.1007/S00415-020-10276-W","title":"Digital biomarkers can highlight subtle clinical differences in radiologically isolated syndrome compared to healthy controls","authors":[{"id":"Mikael Cohen","orcid":"0000-0002-3985-1297","LN":"Cohen","FN":"Mikael","affil":"Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nice (FR)","name":"Mikael Cohen"},{"id":"Lydiane Mondot","orcid":"0000-0002-6396-3264","LN":"Mondot","FN":"Lydiane","affil":"Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nice (FR)","name":"Lydiane Mondot"},{"id":"Salim Fakir","orcid":null,"LN":"Fakir","FN":"Salim","affil":"Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nice (FR)","name":"Salim Fakir"},{"id":"Cassandre Landes","orcid":null,"LN":"Landes","FN":"Cassandre","affil":"Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nice (FR)","name":"Cassandre Landes"},{"id":"Christine Lebrun","orcid":null,"LN":"Lebrun","FN":"Christine","affil":"Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nice (FR)","name":"Christine Lebrun"}],"year":2021,"journal":"Journal of Neurology","references":["W2006096283","W2028942474","W2030113529","W2061184393","W2063158442","W2102945024","W2106098505","W2136592726","W2148563799","W2162472598","W2345649575","W2585480501","W2788905468","W2801837614","W2884714191","W2888480361","W2947825974","W2974007026","W3014262855","W3033592822"],"citationsCount":1,"isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4200388728","numberInSourceReferences":232,"doi":"10.1145/3494970","title":"MSLife","authors":[{"id":"Gabriel Guo","orcid":null,"LN":"Guo","FN":"Gabriel","affil":"Columbia University (US)","name":"Gabriel Guo"},{"id":"Hanbin Zhang","orcid":"0000-0002-8893-4208","LN":"Zhang","FN":"Hanbin","affil":"Buffalo State College (US), University at Buffalo, State University of New York (US)","name":"Hanbin Zhang"},{"id":"Liuyi Yao","orcid":null,"LN":"Yao","FN":"Liuyi","affil":"Buffalo State College (US), University at Buffalo, State University of New York (US)","name":"Liuyi Yao"},{"id":"Huining Li","orcid":null,"LN":"Li","FN":"Huining","affil":"Buffalo State College (US), University at Buffalo, State University of New York (US)","name":"Huining Li"},{"id":"Chenhan Xu","orcid":"0000-0002-1395-4570","LN":"Xu","FN":"Chenhan","affil":"Buffalo State College (US), University at Buffalo, State University of New York (US)","name":"Chenhan Xu"},{"id":"Zhengxiong Li","orcid":"0000-0003-1880-5096","LN":"Li","FN":"Zhengxiong","affil":"University of Colorado Denver (US)","name":"Zhengxiong Li"},{"id":"Wenyao Xu","orcid":null,"LN":"Xu","FN":"Wenyao","affil":"Buffalo State College (US), University at Buffalo, State University of New York (US)","name":"Wenyao Xu"}],"year":2021,"journal":"Proceedings of the ACM on interactive, mobile, wearable and ubiquitous technologies","references":["W24020054","W1277966809","W1489883964","W1507001215","W1555168845","W1600582725","W1773487397","W1828576284","W1940174779","W1969518250","W1977975426","W1992684718","W1993448410","W1997817922","W1999422364","W2001738948","W2008240261","W2009836285","W2011917973","W2013948794","W2015285136","W2017170615","W2020022772","W2026620517","W2027099930","W2028174673","W2031669983","W2033962550","W2038078074","W2039132878","W2040326689","W2041924199","W2046168847","W2047405998","W2049878941","W2061961563","W2064208546","W2067673653","W2072718666","W2072788729","W2074655266","W2079481888","W2088948024","W2089593597","W2089763487","W2095152426","W2099731130","W2100582107","W2112165124","W2112778345","W2114242035","W2127502418","W2134977136","W2135046866","W2137027807","W2138526108","W2143122654","W2144215670","W2150291618","W2151487996","W2153585797","W2156567116","W2159162402","W2168098956","W2168175751","W2176880214","W2336695325","W2345099370","W2347128633","W2516086211","W2560140067","W2753983682","W2794997027","W2805477752","W2911903908","W2917347002","W2939196299","W2945464797","W2954150574","W2970657297","W2996276198","W3000974005","W3002970851","W3023513501","W3103407238","W3118622652","W3135166179","W4239181501"],"citationsCount":0,"abstract":"Treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS) focuses on managing its symptoms (e.g., depression, fatigue, poor sleep quality), varying with specific symptoms experienced. Thus, for optimal treatment, there arises the need to track these symptoms. Towards this goal, there is great interest in finding their relevant phenotypes. Prior research suggests links between activities of daily living (ADLs) and MS symptoms; therefore, we hypothesize that the behavioral phenotype (revealed through ADLs) is closely related to MS symptoms. Traditional approaches to finding behavioral phenotypes which rely on human observation or controlled clinical settings are burdensome and cannot account for all genuine ADLs. Here, we present MSLife, an end-to-end, burden-free approach to digital behavioral phenotyping of MS symptoms in the wild using wearables and graph-based statistical analysis. MSLife is built upon (1) low-cost, unobtrusive wearables (i.e., smartwatches) that can track and quantify ADLs among MS patients in the wild; (2) graph-based statistical analysis that can model the relationships between quantified ADLs (i.e., digital behavioral phenotype) and MS symptoms. We design, implement, and deploy MSLife with 30 MS patients across a one-week home-based IRB-approved clinical pilot study. We use the GENEActiv smartwatch to monitor ADLs and clinical behavioral instruments to collect MS symptoms. Then we develop a graph-based statistical analysis framework to model phenotyping relationships between ADLs and MS symptoms, incorporating confounding demographic factors. We discover 102 significant phenotyping relationships (e.g., later rise times are related to increased levels of depression, history of caffeine consumption is associated with lower fatigue levels, higher relative levels of moderate physical activity are linked with decreased sleep quality). We validate their healthcare implications, using them to track MS symptoms in retrospective analysis. To our best knowledge, this is one of the first practices to digital behavioral phenotyping of MS symptoms in the wild.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2904482525","numberInSourceReferences":172,"doi":"10.1080/02640414.2018.1554614","title":"Validity of the Marshall Sitting Questionnaire in people with multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Jeffer Eidi Sasaki","orcid":null,"LN":"Sasaki","FN":"Jeffer Eidi","affil":"University of Alabama at Birmingham (US)","name":"Jeffer Eidi Sasaki"},{"id":"Robert W.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate segmental control during quiet standing in PwMS and controls to understand whether MS alters use of the ankle and hip strategies to manage postural sway. Coherence of acceleration between the trunk and legs was evaluated with accelerometers placed on the sacrum and lower leg. Thirty-six PwMS and 20 healthy control subjects performed quiet standing with eyes open and closed while center of pressure (CoP) and acceleration of postural sway was measured. Acceleration frequencies were divided into lower frequencies (≤1.0 Hz) and higher frequencies (>1.0 Hz) to categorize sway characteristics. With eyes open, coherence was significantly lower in PwMS compared to controls at lower frequencies only. With eyes closed, coherence was significantly lower in PwMS compared to controls, who use an ankle strategy at lower frequencies only, at both lower and higher frequencies. Both groups showed decreased coherence with increasing frequency when eyes were open and closed. Coherence was significantly correlated with CoP sway area in PwMS during the eyes closed condition only. The reduced coherence in PwMS during both lower and higher frequency sway indicates PwMS utilize a mixed ankle-hip sway strategy regardless of sway frequency. This is in contrast to sway in healthy subjects which utilizes an ankle strategy at lower frequencies and a mixed strategy at higher frequencies. Lack of adaptability in segmental control strategy likely contributes to abnormal postural control, as reflected by CoP sway patterns, in PwMS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2029712634","numberInSourceReferences":14,"doi":"10.1007/S12160-008-9049-4","title":"Does the Relationship Between Physical Activity and Quality of Life Differ Based on Generic Versus Disease-Targeted Instruments?","authors":[{"id":"Robert W.

In particular, the medical community could largely benefit from this type of devices as they could provide the clinicians with a valuable tool for assessing gait impairment. Motion sensor data are however complex and there is an urgent unmet need to develop sound statistical methods for analyzing such data and extracting clinically relevant information. In this article, we measure gait by following the hip rotation over time and the resulting statistical unit is a time series of unit quaternions. We explore the possibility to form groups of patients with similar walking impairment by taking into account their walking data and their global decease severity with semi-supervised clustering. We generalize a compromise-based method named hclustcompro to unit quaternion time series by combining it with the proper dissimilarity quaternion dynamic time warping. We apply this method on patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis to form groups of patients with similar walking deficiencies while accounting for the clinical assessment of their overall disability. We also compare the compromise-based clustering approach with the method mergeTrees that falls into a sub-class of ensemble clustering named collaborative clustering. The results provide a first proof of both the interest of using wearable motion sensors for assessing gait impairment and the use of prior knowledge to guide the clustering process. It also demonstrates that compromise-based clustering is a more appropriate approach in this context.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4310704946","numberInSourceReferences":274,"doi":"10.1007/S00415-022-11494-0","title":"Neural correlates of digital measures shown by structural MRI: a post-hoc analysis of a smartphone-based remote assessment feasibility study in multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Marco Ganzetti","orcid":"0000-0002-7049-171X","LN":"Ganzetti","FN":"Marco","affil":"Roche (CH)","name":"Marco Ganzetti"},{"id":"Jennifer A.

This analysis aimed to explore regional neural correlates of digital measures derived from these tests. Methods In a 24-week, non-randomized, interventional, feasibility study (NCT02952911), sensor-based tests on the Floodlight Proof-of-Concept app were used to assess cognition (smartphone-based electronic Symbol Digit Modalities Test), upper extremity function (Draw a Shape Test, Pinching Test), and gait and balance (Static Balance Test, Two-Minute Walk Test, U-Turn Test). In this post-hoc analysis, digital measures and standard clinical measures (e.g., Nine-Hole Peg Test [9HPT]) were correlated against regional structural magnetic resonance imaging outcomes. Seventy-six PwMS aged 18–55 years with an Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 0.0–5.5 were enrolled from two different sites (USA and Spain). Sixty-two PwMS were included in this analysis. Results Worse performance on digital and clinical measures was associated with smaller regional brain volumes and larger ventricular volumes. Whereas digital and clinical measures had many neural correlates in common (e.g., putamen, globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, lateral occipital cortex), some were observed only for digital measures. For example, Draw a Shape Test and Pinching Test measures, but not 9HPT score, correlated with volume of the hippocampus ( r = 0.37 [drawing accuracy over time on the Draw a Shape Test]/ − 0.45 [touching asynchrony on the Pinching Test]), thalamus ( r = 0.38/ − 0.41), and pons ( r = 0.35/ − 0.35). Conclusions Multiple neural correlates were identified for the digital measures in a cohort of people with early MS. Digital measures showed associations with brain regions that clinical measures were unable to demonstrate, thus providing potential novel information on functional ability compared with standard clinical assessments.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4213363937","numberInSourceReferences":279,"doi":"10.3390/BRAINSCI12020258","title":"Intensive Neurorehabilitation and Gait Improvement in Progressive Multiple Sclerosis: Clinical, Kinematic and Electromyographic Analysis","authors":[{"id":"Su-Chun Huang","orcid":null,"LN":"Huang","FN":"Su-Chun","affil":"Experimental Neurophysiology Unit, Institute of Experimental Neurology-INSPE, Scientific Institute San Raffaele, 20132 Milan, Italy","name":"Su-Chun Huang"},{"id":"Simone Guerrieri","orcid":null,"LN":"Guerrieri","FN":"Simone","affil":"Experimental Neurophysiology Unit, Institute of Experimental Neurology-INSPE, Scientific Institute San Raffaele, 20132 Milan, Italy, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University (IT)","name":"Simone Guerrieri"},{"id":"Gloria Dalla Costa","orcid":"0000-0002-8761-9337","LN":"Costa","FN":"Gloria Dalla","affil":"Experimental Neurophysiology Unit, Institute of Experimental Neurology-INSPE, Scientific Institute San Raffaele, 20132 Milan, Italy, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University (IT)","name":"Gloria Dalla Costa"},{"id":"Marco Pisa","orcid":"0000-0001-9409-6864","LN":"Pisa","FN":"Marco","affil":"Experimental Neurophysiology Unit, Institute of Experimental Neurology-INSPE, Scientific Institute San Raffaele, 20132 Milan, Italy, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University (IT)","name":"Marco Pisa"},{"id":"Giulia Leccabue","orcid":null,"LN":"Leccabue","FN":"Giulia","affil":"Vita-Salute San Raffaele University (IT)","name":"Giulia Leccabue"},{"id":"Lorenzo Gregoris","orcid":null,"LN":"Gregoris","FN":"Lorenzo","affil":"Vita-Salute San Raffaele University (IT)","name":"Lorenzo Gregoris"},{"id":"Giancarlo Comi","orcid":null,"LN":"Comi","FN":"Giancarlo","affil":"Casa di Cura del Policlinico, 20144 Milan, Italy, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University (IT)","name":"Giancarlo Comi"},{"id":"Letizia Leocani","orcid":null,"LN":"Leocani","FN":"Letizia","affil":"Experimental Neurophysiology Unit, Institute of Experimental Neurology-INSPE, Scientific Institute San Raffaele, 20132 Milan, Italy, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University (IT)","name":"Letizia Leocani"}],"year":2022,"journal":"Brain Sciences","references":["W77035131","W203077325","W938213511","W1965225298","W1967496572","W1977116633","W2004319861","W2014127183","W2037993003","W2055522990","W2060715958","W2072013430","W2076858211","W2094011338","W2098291431","W2114242035","W2121149730","W2130873978","W2137424771","W2143194752","W2143567192","W2145481931","W2156527590","W2158177758","W2167615109","W2290390881","W2297433731","W2424514403","W2466956728","W2526655035","W2586165015","W2621399005","W2760351771","W2890032057","W2894191193","W2944700305","W2980412925","W3012094580","W3018899683","W3029517753","W3097078597"],"citationsCount":1,"abstract":"Gait deficit is a hallmark of multiple sclerosis and the walking capacity can be improved with neurorehabilitation.

The primary aim of this study is to propose and validate a protocol for simulating real-world gait accounting for all these factors within a single set of observations, while ensuring minimisation of participant burden and safety. Methods The protocol included eight motor tasks at varying speed, incline/steps, surface, path shape, cognitive demand, and included postures that may abruptly alter the participants’ strategy of walking. It was deployed in a convenience sample of 108 participants recruited from six cohorts that included older healthy adults (HA) and participants with potentially altered mobility due to Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), proximal femoral fracture (PFF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or congestive heart failure (CHF). A novelty introduced in the protocol was the tiered approach to increase difficulty both within the same task (e.g., by allowing use of aids or armrests) and across tasks. Results The protocol proved to be safe and feasible (all participants could complete it and no adverse events were recorded) and the addition of the more complex tasks allowed a much greater spread in walking speeds to be achieved compared to standard straight walking trials. Furthermore, it allowed a representation of a variety of daily life relevant mobility aspects and can therefore be used for the validation of monitoring devices used in real life. Conclusions The protocol allowed for measuring gait in a variety of pathological conditions suggests that it can also be used to detect changes in gait due to, for example, the onset or progression of a disease, or due to therapy.

Several objective measures of UL function are proposed; however, their use is mostly confined to assess subjects with mild-to-moderate disability and requires fine motor skills, often impaired in high disability level subjects. Thus, a tool to score UL function in the advanced disease stage is lacking. The aim of the study is to analyse and compare UL unilateral and bilateral movements of healthy control (HC) and PwMS, at different disability levels, using an instrumented version (Inertial Measurement Unit, IMU) of the 15-seconds finger-to-nose test (FNT). Each movement cycle was segmented in going/adjusting/returning phases. The inter-hand interval (IHI) allowed assessing bilateral coordination (i.e. synchrony) in each phase. The larger IHI, the more severe the bilateral coordination impairment is. After stratifying PwMS for disability level (PwMS<sub>LOW</sub>, Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS≤5.5 and PwMS<sub>HIGH</sub>, EDSS≥6), the ANOVA on IHI showed significant differences between PwMS and HC (p<0.001) in all phases. However, only the going phase IHI showed significantly higher asynchrony in PwMS<sub>HIGH</sub> than PwMS<sub>LOW</sub> and HC (p<0.001) and no differences between PwMS<sub>LOW</sub> and HC. The going phase IHI seems to be a clinical marker specific for high disability level PwMS.

To date, there is limited research regarding mechanisms based on brain imaging for understanding the beneficial effects of physical activity in pwMS. This study examined the relationship between physical activity levels and thalamic and hippocampal volumes and brain metabolism in pwMS. Methods The sample of 52 pwMS (37.3 ± 9.6 years of age; 35 females, 17 males) underwent a combination of volumetric magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Current and lifetime physical activity were assessed using actigraphy and the adapted version of the Historical Activity Questionnaire, respectively. Results Positive associations were observed between both actigraphy and self-reported levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and thalamic and hippocampal volumes. Regarding brain metabolism, actigraphy and self-reported levels of MVPA were positively associated with higher hippocampal and thalamic levels of N-acetylaspartate/creatine ratio (NAA/Cr: marker of neural integrity and cell energy state). Conclusions This study provides novel evidence for a positive association between physical activity and thalamic and hippocampal volume and metabolism in pwMS. These findings support the hypothesis that physical activity, particularly MVPA, may serve as a disease-modifying treatment by improving brain health in pwMS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3129046097","numberInSourceReferences":253,"doi":"10.1177/2055668320966955","title":"Quantifying upper limb tremor in people with multiple sclerosis using Fast Fourier Transform based analysis of wrist accelerometer signals","authors":[{"id":"Stefan Teufl","orcid":null,"LN":"Teufl","FN":"Stefan","affil":"Glasgow Caledonian University (GB)","name":"Stefan Teufl"},{"id":"Jenny Preston","orcid":null,"LN":"Preston","FN":"Jenny","affil":"Ayrshire Central Hospital (GB)","name":"Jenny Preston"},{"id":"Frederike van Wijck","orcid":"0000-0003-0855-799X","LN":"Wijck","FN":"Frederike van","affil":"Glasgow Caledonian University (GB)","name":"Frederike van Wijck"},{"id":"Ben Stansfield","orcid":null,"LN":"Stansfield","FN":"Ben","affil":"Glasgow Caledonian University (GB)","name":"Ben Stansfield"}],"year":2021,"journal":"Journal of rehabilitation and assistive technologies engineering","references":["W1513423926","W1978473739","W2029880888","W2039477946","W2058250069","W2060961286","W2069930252","W2079634942","W2084156920","W2085126485","W2088544038","W2092599090","W2112171382","W2117961309","W2129534580","W2136361599","W2148764702","W2157191484","W2162358973","W2177211981","W2410787994","W2749921372","W3000458390"],"citationsCount":2,"abstract":"Tremor is a disabling symptom of Multiple Sclerosis (MS).

PA participation is associated with lower disease activity, depression and fatigue as well as higher self-efficacy, goal setting and decreased barriers. These latter constructs may be targeted by an intervention program for behavior change, and such intervention must account for disease rarity, geographical proximity and time constraints which limit the feasibility, accessibility, and sustainability of implementing a PA intervention in youth with MS. We have developed a theory-informed mobile-app based PA promotion program to address these barriers, Active Teens with Multiple Sclerosis (ATOMIC) and herein report the feasibility of delivering this intervention in youth with MS.To determine the feasibility of delivering the ATOMIC program to youth with MS.Fifteen youth with MS (13F, 16.6 ± 1.2 years) followed at the Hospital for Sick Children were enrolled in the ATOMIC intervention. Participants underwent a standard clinical evaluation; an exercise test to determine cardiorespiratory fitness; 7-day PA monitoring with an accelerometer; and completed standardized depression, fatigue questionnaires at baseline and post-intervention. Social cognitive scales related to self-efficacy, self-management, goal setting, perceived barriers, outcome expectancy, and social support were completed at baseline, six and 12-weeks. The 12-week mobile app PA intervention was informed by Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) and included: individualized PA coaching, PA self-monitoring (Fitbit), goal setting, social support and MS specific educational modules. Feasibility was defined as (1) meeting the recruitment target of 15 participants within a one-year period; (2) completion of ≥80% of study related questionnaires and testing; (3) a drop-out rate of less than 20%, and (4) adherence to the ATOMIC intervention program components of ≥80% (Fitbit wear, PA coaching calls, modules).From March 2018 to April 2019, 53% of youth approached agreed to participate (15/28). 13/15 participants completed the intervention. 36 of the possible 39 coaching calls (92%: 3 possible phone calls per participant); 89% wear adherence to FitbitCharge2 data (mean = 75 ± 16.6 days of 84 days); and 5/12 (42%) of modules were completed. An average 8.4% (SD= 40%, range = -74.0 to 176%) increase in Fitbit steps above the first week of the intervention were observed. PA level from accelerometry at 12-weeks, aerobic fitness, depression and fatigue were unchanged. SCT scales indicated an increase in social support from friends (0.67-points, T = 2.7, pholm=0.04), and a decrease in outcome expectancy (-2.7, T = 3.0, pholm=0.03). There were no differences in self-efficacy, self-management or perceived barriers post intervention.Our results indicate that the ATOMIC program is feasible for delivery in youth with MS. Future work is needed to understand how to best implement each element of SCT through added features in the mobile-app, and to evaluate how the individual components of SCT mediate change in PA behaviours of youth with MS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3037467386","numberInSourceReferences":196,"doi":"10.7717/PEERJ.9303","title":"Feasibility of a smartphone app to enhance physical activity in progressive MS: a pilot randomized controlled pilot trial over three months","authors":[{"id":"Navina N Nasseri","orcid":null,"LN":"Nasseri","FN":"Navina N","affil":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (DE)","name":"Navina N Nasseri"},{"id":"Eghbal Ghezelbash","orcid":null,"LN":"Ghezelbash","FN":"Eghbal","affil":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (DE)","name":"Eghbal Ghezelbash"},{"id":"Yuyang Zhai","orcid":null,"LN":"Zhai","FN":"Yuyang","affil":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (DE)","name":"Yuyang Zhai"},{"id":"Stefan Patra","orcid":null,"LN":"Patra","FN":"Stefan","affil":"Universitäres Kompetenzzentrum für Sport-und Bewegungsmedizin (Athleticum) und Institut und Poliklinik für Medizinische Psychologie, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.","name":"Stefan Patra"},{"id":"Karin Riemann-Lorenz","orcid":"0000-0002-0779-2640","LN":"Riemann-Lorenz","FN":"Karin","affil":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (DE)","name":"Karin Riemann-Lorenz"},{"id":"Christoph Heesen","orcid":"0000-0001-8131-9467","LN":"Heesen","FN":"Christoph","affil":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (DE)","name":"Christoph Heesen"},{"id":"Anne Christin Rahn","orcid":null,"LN":"Rahn","FN":"Anne Christin","affil":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (DE)","name":"Anne Christin Rahn"},{"id":"Jan-Patrick Stellmann","orcid":null,"LN":"Stellmann","FN":"Jan-Patrick","affil":"University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (DE)","name":"Jan-Patrick Stellmann"}],"year":2020,"journal":"PeerJ","references":["W152339727","W165388696","W1467761934","W1681834762","W1828576284","W1965576196","W1967860258","W1970164923","W1971555130","W1993618946","W1996480774","W2009842780","W2010163891","W2016298327","W2018868993","W2027285375","W2028842616","W2034447597","W2035282943","W2035541251","W2040106495","W2043400629","W2048828717","W2049223663","W2050099111","W2053632257","W2056023173","W2068642589","W2081969938","W2083539525","W2085155902","W2087671528","W2088969218","W2097303544","W2098674711","W2099615474","W2100949052","W2105242813","W2110347409","W2112165124","W2114796009","W2116830312","W2124180267","W2143388381","W2148946362","W2152787748","W2156610258","W2163266133","W2169408223","W2171708575","W2288073912","W2324056668","W2549644306","W2560473567","W2585087946","W2588488142","W2591363645","W2783492302","W2790285286","W2794467452","W2900671058","W2903871511","W2917053521","W2951956205","W4234525547"],"citationsCount":5,"abstract":"People with chronic progressive multiple sclerosis (CPMS) have limited options in medical treatment. Enhancing physical activity (PA) might promote neuroregeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS) and positively influence disability, thus providing an alternative to medical treatment. Previous studies indicate that evidence-based patient information (EBPI) is essential for inducing behavioral change, e.g. enhancing PA.To investigate feasibility of a smartphone app providing EBPI about the benefit of PA and a simple activity feedback to enhance PA in people with CPMS in a pilot randomized controlled trial over 3 months.Thirty-eight people with CPMS (mean age 51 years, median Expanded Disability Status Scale 4.0) were 1:1 randomized into either a control group (n = 20) or an intervention group (n = 18). The intervention group received access to a multimedia EBPI app including activity feedback, texts, figures and videos. In the control group, participants received a leaflet with unspecific information about exercising in general. The EPBI itself was designed based on a systematic review. At baseline and after 3 months, all participants underwent clinical performance tests, filled in questionnaires and received an activity monitor (Actigraph®) for 7 days. The primary endpoint was the rate of responders defined as participants with a 20% increase of physical acitivity (time of moderate or vigiorous PA-MVPA) or 20% increase of the number of steps, both assessed with the activity monitor. As secondary endpoints, we compared accelerometry, performance and questionnaires adjusted for baseline measurments between the groups (ANCOVA). Moreover, we used questionnaires to compare knowledge about exercise (activity requiring physical effort, carried out to improve or improve health and fitness) in MS, usability of the app in general and motivation towards a more active lifestyle after 3 months in both groups.The groups showed significant differences in disease duration and PA according to the Godin-Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire at baseline. After 3 months, we detected no difference in the rate of responders, which was an overall 22%. However, MVPA significantly increased in both groups (p < 0.001) and the intervention group tended to have a higher motivation towards a more active lifestyle (Cohens D = 0.7, p = 0.09) as measured by the questionnaire. Reponses also showed, that participants appreciated the app but claimed a lack of interactivity as a short-coming.Just providing information in a multimedia smartphone app did not enhance physical activitiy more than a simple leaflet in this small pilot trial in CPMS. However, the group of app users tended to have a higher motivation towards a more active lifestyle. Overall, the concept of a smartphone app to support an active lifestyle in MS is highly appreciated by participants.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2969817164","numberInSourceReferences":160,"doi":"10.1186/S12984-019-0573-1","title":"Three distinct physical behavior types in fatigued patients with multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"H.E.M.

Changes in PB are often assumed as a consequence of fatigue, but effects of interventions that aim to reduce fatigue by improving PB are not sufficient. Since the heterogeneous nature of MS related symptoms, levels of PB of fatigued patients at the start of interventions might vary substantially. Better understanding of the variability by identification of PB subtypes in fatigued patients may help to develop more effective personalized rehabilitation programs in the future. This study aimed to identify PB subtypes in fatigued patients with multiple sclerosis based on multidimensional PB outcome measures.Baseline accelerometer (Actigraph) data, demographics and clinical characteristics of the TREFAMS-ACE participants (n = 212) were used for secondary analysis. All patients were ambulatory and diagnosed with severe fatigue based on a score of ≥35 on the fatigue subscale of the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS20r). Fifteen PB measures were used derived from 7 day measurements with an accelerometer. Principal component analysis was performed to define key outcome measures for PB and two-step cluster analysis was used to identify PB types.Analysis revealed five key outcome measures: percentage sedentary behavior, total time in prolonged moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, number of sedentary bouts, and two types of change scores between day parts (morning, afternoon and evening). Based on these outcomes three valid PB clusters were derived.Patients with severe MS-related fatigue show three distinct and homogeneous PB subtypes. These PB subtypes, based on a unique set of PB outcome measures, may offer an opportunity to design more individually-tailored interventions in rehabilitation.Clinical trial registration no ISRCTN 82353628 , ISRCTN 69520623 and ISRCTN 58583714 .","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2804227568","numberInSourceReferences":144,"doi":"10.1177/0361198118772952","title":"Data Quality of Travel Behavior Studies: Factors Influencing the Reporting Rate of Self-Reported and GPS-Recorded Trips in Persons with Disabilities","authors":[{"id":"An Neven","orcid":null,"LN":"Neven","FN":"An","affil":"Hasselt University (BE)","name":"An Neven"},{"id":"Ine De Schutter","orcid":null,"LN":"Schutter","FN":"Ine De","affil":"Hasselt University (BE)","name":"Ine De Schutter"},{"id":"Geert Wets","orcid":null,"LN":"Wets","FN":"Geert","affil":"Hasselt University (BE)","name":"Geert Wets"},{"id":"Peter Feys","orcid":null,"LN":"Feys","FN":"Peter","affil":"Hasselt University (BE)","name":"Peter Feys"},{"id":"Davy Janssens","orcid":null,"LN":"Janssens","FN":"Davy","affil":"Hasselt University (BE)","name":"Davy Janssens"}],"year":2018,"journal":"Transportation Research Record","references":["W614204248","W1964966861","W1971079712","W1981142067","W1982167337","W1983182638","W1986702667","W1996308597","W2007870064","W2012353062","W2033961603","W2053632257","W2053971431","W2057054827","W2084151313","W2093560439","W2113666808","W2140530992","W2141063224","W2143567192","W2161241389","W2188572048","W2322773433","W2398226462","W4241987589","W4254181997","W4292806894"],"citationsCount":2,"abstract":"In persons with disabilities, the accuracy of self-report data collection methods in travel behavior studies may be influenced by disease-related dysfunctions.

Characteristic tremor frequencies in MS have a broad distribution range (1-10 Hz), which confounds the diagnostic from other forms of tremors. In this study, we propose a classification method for distinguishing MS tremors from other forms of cerebellar tremors.Electromyogram (EMG), accelerometer and clinical data were obtained from a total of 120 [40 MS, 41 essential tremor (ET) and 39 Parkinson's disease (PD)] subjects. The proposed method - Soft Decision Wavelet Decomposition (SDWD) - was used to compute power spectral densities and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed for the automatic classification of the tremors. Association between the spectral features and clinical features (FTM - Fahn-Tolosa-Marin scale, UPDRS - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale), was assessed using a support vector regression (SVR) model.Our developed analytical framework achieved an accuracy of up to 91.67% using accelerometer data and up to 91.60% using EMG signals for the differentiation of MS tremors and the tremors from ET and PD. In addition, SVR further revealed strong significant correlations between the selected discriminators and the clinical scores.The proposed method, with high classification accuracy and strong correlations of these features to clinical outcomes, has clearly demonstrated the potential to complement the existing tremor-diagnostic approach in MS patients.This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG): SFB-TR-128 (to SG, MM), MU 4354/1-1(to MM) and the Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds BIF-03 (to SG, MM).","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4225012132","numberInSourceReferences":281,"doi":"10.1007/S00415-022-11134-7","title":"Objectively assessed physiological, physical, and cognitive function along with patient-reported outcomes during the first 2 years of Alemtuzumab treatment in multiple sclerosis: a prospective observational study","authors":[{"id":"Lars G.

Wearable inertial sensors offer the advantages of providing accurate, objective, and reliable measures of gait while streamlining walk test administration. The aim of this study was to develop an inertial sensor-based algorithm to estimate the total distance walked using older subjects with impaired fasting glucose (Study I), and to test the generalizability of the proposed algorithm in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (Study II). All subjects wore two inertial sensors (Opals by Clario-APDM Wearable Technologies) on their feet. The walking distance algorithm was developed based on 108 older adults in Study I performing a 400 m walk test along a 20 m straight walkway. The validity of the algorithm was tested using a 6-minute walk test (6MWT) in two sub-studies of Study II with different lengths of a walkway, 15 m (Study II-A, n = 24) and 20 m (Study II-B, n = 22), respectively. The start and turn around points were marked with lines on the floor while smaller horizontal lines placed every 1 m served to calculate the manual distance walked (ground truth). The proposed algorithm calculates the forward distance traveled during each step as the change in the horizontal position from each foot-flat period to the subsequent foot-flat period. The total distance walked is then computed as the sum of walk distances for each stride, including turns. The proposed algorithm achieved an average absolute error rate of 1.92% with respect to a fixed 400 m distance for Study I. The same algorithm achieved an absolute error rate of 4.17% and 3.21% with respect to an averaged manual distance for 6MWT in Study II-A and Study II-B, respectively. These results demonstrate the potential of an inertial sensor-based algorithm to estimate a total distance walked with good accuracy with respect to the manual, clinical standard. Further work is needed to test the generalizability of the proposed algorithm with different administrators and populations, as well as larger diverse cohorts.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4296829675","numberInSourceReferences":304,"doi":"10.3389/FSPOR.2022.1006422","title":"Disability and physical activity in people with chronic disease receiving physiotherapy.

Longitudinal information on disability and physical activity is generally scarce in patients with chronic disease. The current study aimed to investigate if self-reported disability and physical activity changed in patients with chronic disease receiving physiotherapy. Furthermore, the aim was to assess if an improvement in self-reported disability was related to an increase in objectively measured physical activity and if an aggravation in self-reported disability was related to a decrease in physical activity. Seventy patients with either multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis or stroke receiving free of charge physiotherapy were tested at baseline and 1 year later. Disability was measured with the self-reported modified Ranking Scale-9 Questionnaire and physical activity was objectively measured using tri-axial accelerometry. Neither self-reported disability nor physical activity changed among patients receiving 1 year of free of charge physiotherapy at group level. Furthermore, self-reported change of disability was not expressed with changes in objectively measured physical activity, indicating that the two measures represent two different constructs.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3200869270","numberInSourceReferences":221,"doi":"10.1145/3478098","title":"Smartphone-Based Tapping Frequency as a Surrogate for Perceived Fatigue","authors":[{"id":"Liliana Mondragón Barrios","orcid":null,"LN":"Barrios","FN":"Liliana Mondragón","affil":"ETH Zurich (CH)","name":"Liliana Mondragón Barrios"},{"id":"Pietro Oldrati","orcid":null,"LN":"Oldrati","FN":"Pietro","affil":"University of Zurich (CH)","name":"Pietro Oldrati"},{"id":"Marc Hilty","orcid":null,"LN":"Hilty","FN":"Marc","affil":"University Hospital of Zurich (CH)","name":"Marc Hilty"},{"id":"David Lindlbauer","orcid":null,"LN":"Lindlbauer","FN":"David","affil":"Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, United States","name":"David Lindlbauer"},{"id":"Christian Holz","orcid":null,"LN":"Holz","FN":"Christian","affil":"ETH Zurich (CH)","name":"Christian Holz"},{"id":"Andreas Lutterotti","orcid":null,"LN":"Lutterotti","FN":"Andreas","affil":"University Hospital of Zurich (CH)","name":"Andreas Lutterotti"}],"year":2021,"journal":"Proceedings of the ACM on interactive, mobile, wearable and ubiquitous technologies","references":["W1841347178","W1968049984","W1976470160","W1981968341","W1983334940","W1991983045","W2003189347","W2004907498","W2005377376","W2011810065","W2015285136","W2016566026","W2018810784","W2019994407","W2023312029","W2023850801","W2027126421","W2031180278","W2031636396","W2037902784","W2038157111","W2060099120","W2073297721","W2092588876","W2094827378","W2096451472","W2097751612","W2104411852","W2108230902","W2111298903","W2112165124","W2114847699","W2119526403","W2121149730","W2121304201","W2127372885","W2128767622","W2133072808","W2151475520","W2155175837","W2159162402","W2162659118","W2314565692","W2404153062","W2483678938","W2483804658","W2590979098","W2591088516","W2598088748","W2670441571","W2793848612","W2795312604","W2892120577","W2901244522","W2982848510","W3031193233","W3108040303","W4297833717"],"citationsCount":2,"abstract":"Fatigue is a common symptom in various diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). The current standard method to assess fatigue is through questionnaires, which has several shortcomings; questionnaires are subjective, prone to recall bias, and potentially confounded by other symptoms like stress and depression. Thus, there is an unmet medical need to develop objective and reliable methods to evaluate fatigue. Our study seeks to develop an objective and ubiquitous monitoring tool for assessing fatigue. Leveraging a smartphone-based rapid tapping task, we conducted a two-week in-the-wild study with 35 MS patients. We explore the association between tapping derived metrics and perceived fatigue assessed with two standard clinical scales: fatigue severity scale (FSS) and fatigue scale for motor and cognitive function (FSMC). Our novel smartphone-based fatigue metric, mean tapping frequency, objectively ranks perceived fatigue with a mean AUCROC = .76, CI = [.71, .81] according to the FSMC, and a mean AUCROC = .81, CI = [.76, .86] according to the FSS. These results demonstrate that our approach is feasible and valid in uncontrolled environments. In this work, we provide a promising tool for objective fatigue monitoring to be used in clinical trials and routine medical care.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3171923961","numberInSourceReferences":231,"doi":"10.1155/2021/5589562","title":"Speed but Not Smoothness of Gait Reacts to Rehabilitation in Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Philipp Gulde","orcid":null,"LN":"Gulde","FN":"Philipp","affil":"Centre for Clinical Neuroplasticity Medical Park Loipl, Bischofswiesen, Germany","name":"Philipp Gulde"},{"id":"Joachim Hermsdörfer","orcid":null,"LN":"Hermsdörfer","FN":"Joachim","affil":"Technical University of Munich (DE)","name":"Joachim Hermsdörfer"},{"id":"Peter Rieckmann","orcid":null,"LN":"Rieckmann","FN":"Peter","affil":"Centre for Clinical Neuroplasticity Medical Park Loipl, Bischofswiesen, Germany","name":"Peter Rieckmann"}],"year":2021,"journal":"Multiple Sclerosis International","references":["W1932263918","W1966363861","W1986672798","W2009836285","W2026051200","W2028842616","W2030742234","W2035526069","W2039596867","W2072500831","W2095683814","W2098291431","W2105548401","W2112165124","W2116209324","W2119408292","W2145481931","W2153406727","W2164765179","W2575811785","W2588827222","W2724719322","W2765383089","W2789259524","W2804569392","W2884138838","W2895756852","W2896976781","W2913597401","W2914940609","W2918399910","W2971450739","W2994896897","W2998382978","W3112826883"],"citationsCount":0,"abstract":"Improved gait is one of the leading therapy goals in multiple sclerosis.

Setting. Private specialist clinic for inpatient neurorehabilitation. Main Outcome Measures. Clinical walk tests (timed 25-foot walk test at normal pace, maximum pace over 10 m or 6 min) and IMU-based measures of movement smoothness.All gait parameters were strongly intercorrelated (all p < 0.05), and a model multiple linear regression for the 6MWT revealed short distance velocity (10 m) and movement smoothness as predictors in a strong model (R2adjusted 0.75, p < 0.01). A second model with natural pace on short distance and movement smoothness was almost equally strong (R2adjusted 0.71, p < 0.01). Patients improved their walking speed (p < 0.01), but not smoothness (p = 0.08-0.12), over the course of rehabilitation.Since we were not able to observe improvements in smoothness of gait, we conclude that rehabilitation programs should be adapted to the patient's physiological capacities in order to allow for such improvements in smoothness of gait. Externally valid gait capacity (6MWT) could be predicted by a single walk for 10 s at natural pace.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3164164224","numberInSourceReferences":242,"doi":"10.1145/3452853.3452862","title":"Using wearable inertial sensors to detect different strategies for the sit-to-stand transition in multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Aiswarya Nagasubramony","orcid":null,"LN":"Nagasubramony","FN":"Aiswarya","affil":"Brighton and Sussex Medical School (GB)","name":"Aiswarya Nagasubramony"},{"id":"Rebecca F Player","orcid":null,"LN":"Player","FN":"Rebecca F","affil":"University of Brighton (GB)","name":"Rebecca F Player"},{"id":"Carina E.

It can often be compromised in patients with neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS). OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to determine if different strategies can be detected in the performance of the sit-to-stand transition using gyroscope metrics from wearable inertial sensors in MS and healthy participants. METHODS: 12 ambulatory persons with MS (PwMS) with an EDSS of 1-5.5 were compared with 11 healthy volunteers. Participants performed a Si-St transition and a Timed 25 Foot Walk (T25FW) while fitted with wearable inertial sensors (x-io NGIMU) on the thigh and sternum. Each sensor node recorded 9 channels of data (3 each of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers) over Wi-Fi onto a computer using software provided by the manufacturer. Analysis of wave forms was done using Matlab and peak detection algorithms based on a 6 Hz low pass filter of the signal. RESULTS: The effect of disability on the Si-St transition was that the peak of thigh pitch angular velocity was lower in PwMS than the healthy volunteers (p=0.045, Cliff’s δ = 0.500). The average duration of the momentum transfer phase of sit-to-stand was longer in PwMS in comparison to healthy (p=0.039, Cliff’s delta=0.515). The duration of momentum transfer was strongly correlated with peak thigh angular velocity but only weakly correlated with T25FW performance or the patient reported measures of disability (MSWS-12 and EDSS-s). CONCLUSION: The durations of momentum transfer derived from inertial sensor measurements reflect different movement strategies used by PwMS and healthy individuals for getting out of a chair.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4285382856","numberInSourceReferences":273,"doi":"10.2196/32453","title":"The Usability of a Smartphone-Based Fall Risk Assessment App for Adult Wheelchair Users: Observational Study","authors":[{"id":"Mikaela L Frechette","orcid":"0000-0001-7967-833X","LN":"Frechette","FN":"Mikaela L","affil":"University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (US)","name":"Mikaela L Frechette"},{"id":"Jason Fanning","orcid":null,"LN":"Fanning","FN":"Jason","affil":"Wake Forest University (US)","name":"Jason Fanning"},{"id":"Katherine L.

Mobile health technology is a possible avenue to provide fall risk assessment. The promise of this approach is dependent upon its usability. Objective We aimed to determine the usability of a fall risk mobile health app and identify key technology development insights for aging adults who use wheeled devices. Methods Two rounds (with 5 participants in each round) of usability testing utilizing an iterative design-evaluation process were performed. Participants completed use of the custom-designed fall risk app, Steady-Wheels. To quantify fall risk, the app led participants through 12 demographic questions and 3 progressively more challenging seated balance tasks. Once completed, participants shared insights on the app’s usability through semistructured interviews and completion of the Systematic Usability Scale. Testing sessions were recorded and transcribed. Codes were identified within the transcriptions to create themes. Average Systematic Usability Scale scores were calculated for each round. Results The first round of testing yielded 2 main themes: ease of use and flexibility of design. Systematic Usability Scale scores ranged from 72.5 to 97.5 with a mean score of 84.5 (SD 11.4). After modifications were made, the second round of testing yielded 2 new themes: app layout and clarity of instruction. Systematic Usability Scale scores improved in the second iteration and ranged from 87.5 to 97.5 with a mean score of 91.9 (SD 4.3). Conclusions The mobile health app, Steady-Wheels, has excellent usability and the potential to provide adult wheeled device users with an easy-to-use, remote fall risk assessment tool. Characteristics that promoted usability were guided navigation, large text and radio buttons, clear and brief instructions accompanied by representative illustrations, and simple error recovery. Intuitive fall risk reporting was achieved through the presentation of a single number located on a color-coordinated continuum that delineated low, medium, and high risk.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3088649450","numberInSourceReferences":187,"doi":"10.1109/MSM49833.2020.9201642","title":"Biomechanical markers of impaired motor coordination","authors":[{"id":"Kristina Daunoravičienė","orcid":null,"LN":"Daunoravičienė","FN":"Kristina","affil":"Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (LT)","name":"Kristina Daunoravičienė"},{"id":"Jurgita Ziziene","orcid":null,"LN":"Ziziene","FN":"Jurgita","affil":"Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (LT)","name":"Jurgita Ziziene"},{"id":"Julius Griškevičius","orcid":"0000-0003-1184-1641","LN":"Griškevičius","FN":"Julius","affil":"Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (LT)","name":"Julius Griškevičius"},{"id":"Rasa Kizlaitiene","orcid":"0000-0002-0493-9686","LN":"Kizlaitiene","FN":"Rasa","affil":"Vilnius University (LT)","name":"Rasa Kizlaitiene"},{"id":"Agne Ovcinikova","orcid":null,"LN":"Ovcinikova","FN":"Agne","affil":"Vilnius University (LT)","name":"Agne Ovcinikova"}],"year":2020,"journal":null,"references":["W101157939","W1543068548","W1969422637","W2004825198","W2027505718","W2070119935","W2074802873","W2101408704","W2109630689","W2112165124","W2143180951","W2144593654","W2160146756","W2165744315","W2227371161","W2472878633","W2586994907","W2605735509","W2782388708","W2794965886","W2803227070","W2889466198","W2898774549","W2937189654","W2938935800","W2977598256","W2979783845","W2984612893"],"citationsCount":0,"abstract":"This study is devoted to movement analysis from a biomechanical perspective to evaluate coordination lesions.

Standardized as Finger-to-Nose (FNT) and The Heel-to-Shin (HST) tests are the most frequently used tests for qualitative examination of upper and lower body coordination. Inertial sensors facilitate in performing quantitative motion analysis and by estimating body symmetry more accurately assess coordination lesion and imbalance. OBJECTIVES: To assess the body symmetry of upper and lower limbs quantitatively, and to find the best body symmetry indices to discriminate MS from healthy individuals (CO). METHODS: 28 MS patients and 23 CO participated in the study. Spatiotemporal parameters obtained from six Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) were placed on the upper and lower extremities during FNT and HST tests. All data were analyzed using statistical methods in MATLAB. RESULTS: Asymmetry indices of temporal parameters showed a significant increase in upper body and lower body asymmetry of MS compared to CO. However, CO have a greater kinematic asymmetry compared to MS. CONCLUSION: Temporal parameters are the most sensitive to body asymmetry evaluation. However, range of motion is completely inappropriate if it is calculated for one movement cycle.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3015293078","numberInSourceReferences":205,"doi":"10.1007/S00702-020-02190-2","title":"The immediate effect of stroboscopic visual training on information-processing time in people with multiple sclerosis: an exploratory study","authors":[{"id":"Nov Shalmoni","orcid":null,"LN":"Shalmoni","FN":"Nov","affil":"Tel Aviv University (IL), Sheba Medical Center (IL)","name":"Nov Shalmoni"},{"id":"Alon Kalron","orcid":"0000-0001-7999-0868","LN":"Kalron","FN":"Alon","affil":"Tel Aviv University (IL)","name":"Alon Kalron"}],"year":2020,"journal":"Journal of Neural Transmission","references":["W1978958996","W1989438394","W2001818617","W2027657102","W2033295861","W2043413874","W2046090172","W2052638649","W2082494913","W2089758510","W2100135031","W2100493195","W2112165124","W2114728329","W2122545833","W2130632081","W2151423278","W2164146178","W2181269459","W2346504495","W2606165363","W2767518837","W2886716378","W2889074191","W2942225646","W2983125340"],"citationsCount":3,"isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2916524100","numberInSourceReferences":165,"doi":"10.1016/J.GAITPOST.2019.02.022","title":"The ability of the instrumented tandem walking tests to discriminate fully ambulatory people with MS from healthy adults","authors":[{"id":"Yevgenia Grinberg","orcid":null,"LN":"Grinberg","FN":"Yevgenia","affil":"Tel Aviv University (IL)","name":"Yevgenia Grinberg"},{"id":"Shani Berkowitz","orcid":null,"LN":"Berkowitz","FN":"Shani","affil":"Tel Aviv University (IL), Sheba Medical Center (IL)","name":"Shani Berkowitz"},{"id":"Leora Hershkovitz","orcid":null,"LN":"Hershkovitz","FN":"Leora","affil":"Tel Aviv University (IL), Sheba Medical Center (IL)","name":"Leora Hershkovitz"},{"id":"Ofir Malcay","orcid":null,"LN":"Malcay","FN":"Ofir","affil":"Tel Aviv University (IL)","name":"Ofir Malcay"},{"id":"Alon Kalron","orcid":"0000-0001-7999-0868","LN":"Kalron","FN":"Alon","affil":"Tel Aviv University (IL)","name":"Alon Kalron"}],"year":2019,"journal":"Gait & Posture","references":["W1800257208","W1829082584","W1968010387","W1972076182","W1996474271","W2001818617","W2011087852","W2024355980","W2029009908","W2043572283","W2049223663","W2053605989","W2074911228","W2076872391","W2077059336","W2086646779","W2112165124","W2112374874","W2122545833","W2127810142","W2161604210","W2164331547","W2386792511","W2512303823","W2517415984","W2549473940","W2565485137","W2606165363","W2793353546","W2898398953","W4250145052"],"citationsCount":8,"abstract":"People with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) experience walking and balance deficits at the initial phases of the disease, even when classified as only minimally disabled. Complex balance tasks, such as tandem walking, are probably more sensitive in detecting mild balance difficulties compared to the standard traditional tests in this population.The aim was to investigate different types of 3-meter tandem walking tests in fully ambulatory PwMS.This observational case-control study included 50 participants; 25 PwMS, 17 women and 8 men, aged 35.2 (S.D = 8.6) and 25 healthy subjects, 18 women and 7 men, aged 34.3 (S.D = 6.1). The 3-meter tandem walk tests were performed during a single session. Each subject completed a sequence of 3 consecutive tests under 3 different task conditions: normal tandem walking, backward tandem walking and cognitive tandem walking. Tandem walking tests were evaluated via three small, lightweight axial wearable accelerometers (APDM, Oregon, USA).The mean EDSS for the MS group was 1.6 (S.D = 0.6) indicating minimal disability. PwMS walked slower and at a slower pace, with a prolonged double support and decreased swing phase compared to healthy subjects in normal and backward conditions. In contrast, during the cognitive task, non-significant differences were found in gait measures between the PwMS and the healthy controls. Significant differences were found between task conditions for all participants. All reduced their walking speed and walked at a slower pace in both the cognitive and backward conditions compared to the normal tandem walk condition. However, non-significant scores were found for the condition X group factor.The study provides new insights into the 3-meter tandem walk test. Findings should improve evaluation and training of dynamic balance in fully ambulatory PwMS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2897347171","numberInSourceReferences":148,"doi":"10.1007/S00702-018-1939-4","title":"Is the dual-task cost of walking and texting unique in people with multiple sclerosis?","authors":[{"id":"Bilal Sirhan","orcid":null,"LN":"Sirhan","FN":"Bilal","affil":"Tel Aviv University (IL)","name":"Bilal Sirhan"},{"id":"Lior Frid","orcid":null,"LN":"Frid","FN":"Lior","affil":"Sheba Medical Center (IL)","name":"Lior Frid"},{"id":"Alon Kalron","orcid":"0000-0001-7999-0868","LN":"Kalron","FN":"Alon","affil":"Tel Aviv University (IL)","name":"Alon Kalron"}],"year":2018,"journal":"Journal of Neural Transmission","references":["W1103140600","W1969736110","W1971423339","W2013643373","W2034660520","W2086646779","W2112165124","W2123261097","W2127810142","W2161818056","W2162626411","W2516553076","W2566676739","W2588292672","W2696402790","W2737065759","W2768376244","W2777074421","W2884837017"],"citationsCount":6,"isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2755110924","numberInSourceReferences":124,"doi":"10.1007/S00415-017-8612-Y","title":"‘Timed up and go’ and brain atrophy: a preliminary MRI study to assess functional mobility performance in multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Lorena Lorefice","orcid":null,"LN":"Lorefice","FN":"Lorena","affil":"University of Cagliari (IT)","name":"Lorena Lorefice"},{"id":"Giancarlo Coghe","orcid":null,"LN":"Coghe","FN":"Giancarlo","affil":"University of Cagliari (IT)","name":"Giancarlo Coghe"},{"id":"Giuseppe Fenu","orcid":"0000-0003-4762-5043","LN":"Fenu","FN":"Giuseppe","affil":"University of Cagliari (IT)","name":"Giuseppe Fenu"},{"id":"Micaela Porta","orcid":"0000-0003-3835-6507","LN":"Porta","FN":"Micaela","affil":"University of Cagliari (IT)","name":"Micaela Porta"},{"id":"Giuseppina Pilloni","orcid":"0000-0001-6226-5627","LN":"Pilloni","FN":"Giuseppina","affil":"University of Cagliari (IT)","name":"Giuseppina Pilloni"},{"id":"Jessica Frau","orcid":null,"LN":"Frau","FN":"Jessica","affil":"University of Cagliari (IT)","name":"Jessica Frau"},{"id":"Federica Corona","orcid":"0000-0002-4928-5129","LN":"Corona","FN":"Federica","affil":"University of Cagliari (IT)","name":"Federica Corona"},{"id":"Vittoria Sechi","orcid":null,"LN":"Sechi","FN":"Vittoria","affil":"ATS Sardegna (IT)","name":"Vittoria Sechi"},{"id":"M.A. Barracciu","orcid":null,"LN":"Barracciu","FN":"M.A.","affil":"ATS Sardegna (IT)","name":"M.A. Barracciu"},{"id":"Mg Marrosu","orcid":null,"LN":"Marrosu","FN":"Mg","affil":"University of Cagliari (IT)","name":"Mg Marrosu"},{"id":"Massimiliano Pau","orcid":"0000-0001-9835-3629","LN":"Pau","FN":"Massimiliano","affil":"University of Cagliari (IT)","name":"Massimiliano Pau"},{"id":"Eleonora Cocco","orcid":null,"LN":"Cocco","FN":"Eleonora","affil":"University of Cagliari (IT)","name":"Eleonora Cocco"}],"year":2017,"journal":"Journal of Neurology","references":["W1965545788","W1974704788","W2011479082","W2026913491","W2028942474","W2063064947","W2068326435","W2080003981","W2086080135","W2101847606","W2105206040","W2112165124","W2122545833","W2134809220","W2142577589","W2147062889","W2161634194","W2162705189","W2273220492","W2290390881","W2341812482","W2562276035","W2607430753","W2732607870"],"citationsCount":11,"isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2262044603","numberInSourceReferences":85,"doi":"10.1088/1741-2560/12/4/046011","title":"Hilbert–Huang transform based instrumental assessment of intention tremor in multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Ilaria Carpinella","orcid":"0000-0001-7486-0706","LN":"Carpinella","FN":"Ilaria","affil":"Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation (IT)","name":"Ilaria Carpinella"},{"id":"Davide Cattaneo","orcid":null,"LN":"Cattaneo","FN":"Davide","affil":"Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation (IT)","name":"Davide Cattaneo"},{"id":"Maurizio Ferrarin","orcid":null,"LN":"Ferrarin","FN":"Maurizio","affil":"Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation (IT)","name":"Maurizio Ferrarin"}],"year":2015,"journal":"Journal of Neural Engineering","references":["W1971961039","W1975465422","W1978087726","W1978473739","W1991528592","W1995604247","W2001193814","W2007221293","W2043779988","W2047401293","W2058250069","W2061514087","W2066091146","W2066428076","W2071890760","W2072518603","W2078630564","W2089667477","W2104262787","W2105490558","W2105532434","W2112165124","W2112171382","W2112983587","W2113840931","W2117961309","W2120390927","W2123354643","W2123467994","W2127353153","W2127406349","W2128574578","W2129534580","W2131368080","W2132168580","W2132176043","W2133072808","W2138498010","W2144185457","W2145016488","W2148764702","W2150329199","W2157191484","W2160506106","W2162254031","W2162358973","W2163374897","W4238817301"],"citationsCount":8,"abstract":"This paper describes a method to extract upper limb intention tremor from gyroscope data, through the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), a technique suitable for the study of nonlinear and non-stationary processes.

The results were compared to those obtained after traditional linear filtering. The tremor amplitude was quantified with instrumental indexes (TIs) and clinical FTRS ratings.The TIs computed after HHT-based filtering discriminated between CO and MS subjects with clinically-detected intention tremor (MS_T). In particular, TIs were significantly higher in the final part of the movement (TI2) with respect to the first part (TI1), and, for all components (X, Y, Z), MS_T showed a TI2 significantly higher than in CO subjects. Moreover, the HHT detected subtle alterations not visible from clinical ratings, as TI2 (Z-component) was significantly increased in MS subjects without clinically-detected tremor (MS_NT). The method's validity was demonstrated by significant correlations between clinical FTRS scores and TI2 related to X (rs = 0.587, p = 0.006) and Y (rs = 0.682, p < 0.001) components. Contrarily, fewer differences among the groups and no correlation between instrumental and clinical indexes emerged after traditional filtering.The present results supported the use of the HHT-based procedure for a fully-automated quantitative and objective measure of intention tremor in MS, which can overcome the limitations of clinical scales and provide supplementary information about this sign.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W1527181082","numberInSourceReferences":92,"doi":"10.1155/2015/482536","title":"Objectively Measured Physical Activity Is Associated with Brain Volumetric Measurements in Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Rachel E.

In conclusion, the FAMOS enables continuous data acquisition and estimation of multiple physiological and functional parameters. It provides a new, flexible and objective approach to study fatigue in MS, which can distinguish between fatigued MS patients and healthy controls. The usability and reliability of the FAMOS should however be further improved and validated through larger clinical trials.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4223585827","numberInSourceReferences":259,"doi":"10.1109/TBME.2022.3166705","title":"Evaluation of Muscle Synergy During Exoskeleton-Assisted Walking in Persons With Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Taimoor Afzal","orcid":"0000-0002-2060-398X","LN":"Afzal","FN":"Taimoor","name":"Taimoor Afzal"},{"id":"Fangshi Zhu","orcid":null,"LN":"Zhu","FN":"Fangshi","name":"Fangshi Zhu"},{"id":"Shih-Feng Tseng","orcid":null,"LN":"Tseng","FN":"Shih-Feng","name":"Shih-Feng Tseng"},{"id":"John A.

There is preliminary evidence of improved walking with a lower limb exoskeleton in persons with MS. However, the effects of exoskeleton-assisted walking on neuromuscular modifications are relatively unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the muscle synergies, their activation patterns and the differences in neural strategies during walking with (EXO) and without (No-EXO) an exoskeleton.Ten subjects with MS performed walking during EXO and No-EXO conditions. Electromyography signals from seven leg muscles were recorded. Muscle synergies and the activation profiles were extracted using non-negative matrix factorization.The stance phase duration was significantly shorter during EXO compared to the No-EXO condition (p<0.05). Moreover, typically 3-5 modules were extracted in each condition. The module-1 (comprising Vastus Medialis and Rectus Femoris muscles), module-2 (comprising Soleus and Medial Gastrocnemius muscles), module-3 (Tibialis Anterior muscle) and module-4 (comprising Biceps Femoris and Semitendinosus muscles) were comparable between conditions. During EXO condition, Semitendinosus and Vastus Medialis emerged in module-5 in 7/10 subjects. Compared to No-EXO, average activation amplitude was significantly reduced corresponding to module-2 during the stance phase and module-3 during the swing phase during EXO.Exoskeleton-assistance does not alter the existing synergy modules, but could induce a new module to emerge, and alters the control of these modules, i.e., modifies the neural commands indicated by the reduced amplitude of the activation profiles.The work provides insights on the potential underlying mechanism of improving gait functions after exoskeleton-assisted locomotor training.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4283824153","numberInSourceReferences":276,"doi":"10.3389/FIMMU.2022.842269","title":"Acute Thermoregulatory and Cardiovascular Response to Submaximal Exercise in People With Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Elisa Gervasoni","orcid":null,"LN":"Gervasoni","FN":"Elisa","affil":"Don Carlo Gnocchi Foundation (IT)","name":"Elisa Gervasoni"},{"id":"Rita Bertoni","orcid":"0000-0001-9533-5716","LN":"Bertoni","FN":"Rita","name":"Rita Bertoni"},{"id":"Denise Anastasi","orcid":null,"LN":"Anastasi","FN":"Denise","name":"Denise Anastasi"},{"id":"Claudio Solaro","orcid":null,"LN":"Solaro","FN":"Claudio","name":"Claudio Solaro"},{"id":"Rachele Di Giovanni","orcid":"0000-0003-4723-9302","LN":"Giovanni","FN":"Rachele Di","name":"Rachele Di Giovanni"},{"id":"Erica Grange","orcid":null,"LN":"Grange","FN":"Erica","name":"Erica Grange"},{"id":"Lawrence Rice","orcid":"0000-0003-2419-0833","LN":"Rice","FN":"Lawrence","name":"Lawrence Rice"},{"id":"Marco Rovaris","orcid":null,"LN":"Rovaris","FN":"Marco","name":"Marco Rovaris"},{"id":"Davide Cattaneo","orcid":null,"LN":"Cattaneo","FN":"Davide","name":"Davide Cattaneo"},{"id":"Martina A.

However, the kinetic and magnitude of adaptation of the internal load and of the core body temperature (CBT) to a submaximal continuous exercise has been poorly addressed in PwMS; this may be relevant for the brief exercise bouts usually occurring in normal daily life. The aim of this work was to evaluate whether multiple sclerosis influences the acute adaptation of the internal load, the CBT and the perceptual load in response to a constant submaximal work step. Methods CBT has been continuously monitored (0.5 Hz) by a validated wearable heat-flux sensor and electrocardiography was recorded (250 Hz) by a wearable device during a standard 6-minute walk test (6MWT) in 14 PwMS (EDSS, 4.7 ± 1.2; disease duration: 13.0 ± 10.2 years; m ± SD) and 14 age, sex and BMI-matched healthy subjects (HS). The rate of perceived exertion (RPE) of the lower limbs was assessed during the 6MWT by the Borg scale (6-20). Results As expected, PwMS walked a significantly shorter distance (361 ± 98 m) than the HS group (613 ± 62 m, p&amp;lt;0.001 vs PwMS). However, the kinetics of adaptation of CBT and the magnitude of CBT change from baseline did not differ between groups. Similarly, heart rate (HR) kinetics and HR change from baseline were comparable between groups during the 6MWT. Finally, lower limbs RPE gradually increased during the exercise test, but without significant differences between groups. Conclusion The internal load, the metabolic heat production, and the perceptive load due to a standard submaximal walking exercise seems to be preserved in PwMS, suggesting a comparable acute heat production and dissipation during exercise. Therefore, it is unlikely that the different distance achieved during the 6MWT may be caused by altered thermoregulatory responses to exercise.

Regularly quantifying these mobility limitations can be used to measure disease progression and the effect of treatment. This information can be used to provide a more individualized treatment. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) can be utilized to quantify mobility in different contexts. However, algorithms are required to extract valuable parameters out of the raw IMU data. These algorithms need to be validated to make sure that they extract the features they should extract. This validation should be performed per disease since different mobility limitations or symptoms can influence the performance of an algorithm in different ways. Therefore, this dataset contains data from both healthy subjects and patients with neurological diseases (Parkinson’s disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis, chronic low back pain). The full bodies of 167 subjects were measured with IMUs and an optical motion capture (reference) system.

A major limitation in fall detection algorithm development is an absence of real-world falls data. Fall detection algorithms are typically trained on simulated fall data that contain a well-balanced number of examples of falls and activities of daily living. However, real-world falls occur infrequently, making them difficult to capture and causing severe data imbalance. People with multiple sclerosis (MS) fall frequently, and their risk of falling increases with disease progression. Because of their high fall incidence, people with MS provide an ideal model for studying falls. This paper describes the development of a context-aware fall detection system based on inertial sensors and time of flight sensors that is robust to imbalance, which is trained and evaluated on real-world falls in people with MS. The algorithm uses an auto-encoder that detects fall candidates using reconstruction error of accelerometer signals followed by a hyper-ensemble of balanced random forests trained using both acceleration and movement features. On a clinical dataset obtained from 25 people with MS monitored over eight weeks during free-living conditions, 54 falls were observed and our system achieved a sensitivity of 92.14%, and false-positive rate of 0.65 false alarms per day.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3201879130","numberInSourceReferences":216,"doi":"10.23919/AE51540.2021.9542904","title":"Parameterization of the Tremor Signal from Accelerometers in Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Vojtech Adam","orcid":null,"LN":"Adam","FN":"Vojtech","affil":"Czech Technical University in Prague (CZ)","name":"Vojtech Adam"},{"id":"Jan Havlik","orcid":"0000-0002-6548-0274","LN":"Havlik","FN":"Jan","affil":"Czech Technical University in Prague (CZ)","name":"Jan Havlik"}],"year":2021,"journal":"2021 International Conference on Applied Electronics (AE)","references":["W1601849952","W1990701202","W2031017716","W2092599090","W2133451173","W2157191484","W2159294672","W2162358973","W2589005373","W2811430242","W4252684946","W4255375128"],"citationsCount":1,"abstract":"Tremor, an involuntary and rhythmic oscillatory movement of a part of the human body, is a part of complex movement disorder in multiple sclerosis (MS).

Here, we posed 5 questions: 1) How many weeks of VTfb training are required to obtain the best short-term carry over effect (CoE) with VTfb? 2) How long does the CoE last once VTfb training terminates? 3) Is the benefit similar for stance and gait? 4) Is position or velocity based VTfb more effective in reducing trunk sway? 5) Do patients' subjective assessments of balance control improve?  Methods Balance control of 16 MS patients was measured with gyroscopes at the lower trunk. The gyroscopes drove directionally active VTfb in a head-band. Patients trained twice per week with VTfb for 4 weeks to determine when balance control with and without VTfb stopped improving. Thereafter, weekly assessments without VTfb over 4 weeks and at 6 months determined when CoEs ended.  Results A 20% improvement in balance to normal levels occurred with VTfb. Short term CoEs improved from 15 to 20% (p ≤ 0.001). Medium term (1–4 weeks) CoEs were constant at 19% (p ≤ 0.001). At 6 months improvement was not significant, 9%. Most improvement was for lateral sway. Equal improvement occurred when angle position or velocity drove VTfb. Subjectively, balance improvements peaked after 3 weeks of training (32%, p ≤ 0.05).  Conclusions 3–4 weeks VTfb training yields clinically relevant sway reductions and subjective improvements for MS patients during stance and gait. The CoEs lasted at least 1 month. Velocity-based VTfb was equally effective as position-based VTfb.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3167498052","numberInSourceReferences":223,"doi":"10.1016/J.SLEEP.2021.06.005","title":"Validity and reliability of the suggested immobilization test for measurement of restless legs syndrome severity in adults with multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Katie L.J.

The current gold-standard measures of RLS severity rely on a fixed seven-day time frame, which limits the ability of these measures for studying acute changes in RLS severity. The present study examined if subjective and objective scores from the suggested immobilization test (SIT) provide a valid and reliable acute measure of RLS severity in persons with MS. Participants with MS and RLS (n = 20) and MS without RLS (n = 20) were matched by age, gender, and disability. All participants completed validated questionnaires for RLS severity followed by the SIT, conducted at 18:00 (±15 min) on the same day of the week for two consecutive weeks. Participants wore accelerometer devices for seven nights to capture periodic limb movements (PLMs) during the night. Self-reported RLS severity during the SIT had excellent construct validity and convergent validity, but moderate test-retest reliability. Device-measured PLMs, while not themselves a direct measure of RLS severity, were significantly associated with PLMs during the night and had excellent test-retest reliability during the SIT in adults with MS. Our results suggest that the SIT represents a valid acute measure for capturing self-reported sensory aspects of RLS severity and should be considered in future research and clinical practice as a standardized acute measure of subjective RLS severity in adults with MS who present with RLS. • Self-reported RLS severity during the SIT had excellent construct validity. • Self-reported RLS severity during the SIT had excellent convergent validity. • Self-reported RLS severity during the SIT had moderate test-retest reliability. • Device-measured PLMs during the SIT had excellent test-retest reliability. • Device-measured PLMs during the SIT were associated with PLMs during sleep.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3161645305","numberInSourceReferences":230,"doi":"10.3390/JCM10102177","title":"Inpatient Rehabilitation: Prediction of Changes in Sensorimotor Performance in Multiple Sclerosis: A Pilot Study","authors":[{"id":"Philipp Gulde","orcid":null,"LN":"Gulde","FN":"Philipp","affil":"Center for Clinical Neuroplasticity Medical Park Loipl, Medical Park SE, Thanngasse 15, 83483 Bischofswiesen, Germany.","name":"Philipp Gulde"},{"id":"Joachim Hermsdörfer","orcid":null,"LN":"Hermsdörfer","FN":"Joachim","affil":"Technical University of Munich (DE)","name":"Joachim Hermsdörfer"},{"id":"Peter Rieckmann","orcid":null,"LN":"Rieckmann","FN":"Peter","affil":"Center for Clinical Neuroplasticity Medical Park Loipl, Medical Park SE, Thanngasse 15, 83483 Bischofswiesen, Germany.","name":"Peter Rieckmann"}],"year":2021,"journal":"Journal of Clinical Medicine","references":["W2011408110","W2011781303","W2022850051","W2035088112","W2046510900","W2087484885","W2102111608","W2104878804","W2112165124","W2125890869","W2162543039","W2172231159","W2553013649","W2568006806","W2749992340","W2772511794","W2791303040","W2941552762","W2949457793","W3039962520","W3112826883","W4234125063"],"citationsCount":4,"abstract":"Inpatient rehabilitation has been shown to be an effective intervention for sensorimotor performance in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. So far, predictions of the rehabilitation outcomes are limited. The objective was to predict inpatient rehabilitation outcomes by changes in the Watzmann Severity Scale (WSS), a statistical estimation of the EDSS by sensorimotor capacity. Sensorimotor performance and physical activity during rehabilitation (by actigraphy) were assessed in a sample of 28 MS patients at a facility for neurorehabilitation. Daily changes in the WSS were predicted by a model of multiple linear regression. The resulting model had an R2adjusted of 0.48 (p &lt; 0.01) and revealed five impacting factors (a reduction in the WSS represents an improvement): the number of steps (β-weight = 0.52, p &lt; 0.01), the duration of nocturnal rest time (β-weight = 0.46, p = 0.01), the EDSS at entry (β-weight = 0.38, p = 0.03), a relapsing-remitting MS (β-weight = 0.37, p = 0.03), and the performance in a visuomotor pursuit task with time pressure (β-weight = −0.35, p = 0.04). One standard deviation improvement was predicted when the patient at admission yielded 6600 fewer steps per day, 94 min less rest per night, −2.7 points in the EDSS at entry, a relapsing-remitting MS, and a pursuit task performance that decreased by 2.2 standard deviations. Overall, the patients improved by −0.22 ± 0.51 WSS points during 19.3 ± 4.5 d of inpatient rehabilitation. Different potential explanations of the findings are discussed, one of which proposes that the results reflect an unhealthy lifestyle which, in addition to MS, would explain the higher predicted improvements by rehabilitation tackling both MS and the patients’ lifestyle.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3200791989","numberInSourceReferences":233,"doi":"10.1016/J.MSARD.2021.103270","title":"Comparing fall detection methods in people with multiple sclerosis: a prospective observational cohort study","authors":[{"id":"Andrea Hildebrand","orcid":"0000-0002-1277-1588","LN":"Hildebrand","FN":"Andrea","affil":"VA Portland Health Care System (US), Oregon Health & Science University (US)","name":"Andrea Hildebrand"},{"id":"Peter Jacobs","orcid":null,"LN":"Jacobs","FN":"Peter","affil":"Oregon Health & Science University (US)","name":"Peter Jacobs"},{"id":"Jonathon Folsom","orcid":null,"LN":"Folsom","FN":"Jonathon","affil":"Oregon Health & Science University (US)","name":"Jonathon Folsom"},{"id":"Clara Mosquera-Lopez","orcid":"0000-0003-1586-2490","LN":"Mosquera-Lopez","FN":"Clara","affil":"Oregon Health & Science University (US)","name":"Clara Mosquera-Lopez"},{"id":"Eric Yuk Fai Wan","orcid":null,"LN":"Wan","FN":"Eric Yuk Fai","affil":"Portland State University (US)","name":"Eric Yuk Fai Wan"},{"id":"Michelle Cameron","orcid":null,"LN":"Cameron","FN":"Michelle","affil":"VA Portland Health Care System (US), Oregon Health & Science University (US)","name":"Michelle Cameron"}],"year":2021,"journal":"Multiple sclerosis and related disorders","references":["W645314983","W1763709863","W1968517534","W1973464566","W1974704788","W1989081063","W2003759089","W2005877913","W2007683147","W2013159382","W2017803470","W2023756500","W2043495858","W2057251037","W2058413834","W2059502783","W2060866511","W2064936982","W2074099390","W2079118768","W2082361295","W2084563367","W2085478833","W2086739877","W2087469646","W2089916011","W2100716893","W2119126533","W2119228914","W2130629933","W2138807185","W2150725604","W2157087000","W2162596555","W2164772540","W2166281216","W2166893402","W2169558892","W2270861330","W2298692413","W2299659248","W2319308093","W2327041205","W2336226252","W2338892592","W2540445744","W2543632018","W2785975688","W2790231294","W2896783937","W2901140528","W3046200777","W3084470509"],"citationsCount":1,"abstract":"<h2>Abstract</h2> Background Falls occur across the population but are more common, and have more negative sequelae, in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Given the prevalence and impact of falls, accurate measures of fall frequency are needed. This study compares the sensitivity and false discovery rates of three methods of fall detection: the current gold standard, prospective paper fall calendars, real-time self-reporting and automated detection, the latter two from a novel body-worn device. Methods Falls in twenty-five people with MS were recorded for eight weeks with prospective fall calendars, real-time body-worn self-report, and an automated body-worn detector concurrently. Eligible individuals were adults with MS enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of a fall prevention intervention. Entry criteria were at least two falls or near-falls in the previous two months, Expanded Disability Status Scale ≤ 6.0, community dwelling, and no MS relapse in the previous month. The sensitivity (proportion of true falls detected) and false discovery rates (proportion of false reports generated) of the fall detection methods were compared. A true fall was a fall reported by at least two methods. A false report was a fall reported by only one method. The trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02583386) and is closed. Results In the 1,276 person-days of fall counting with all three methods in use simultaneously there were 1344 unique fall events. Of these, 8.5% (114) were true falls and 91.5% (1230) were false reports. Fall calendars had the lowest sensitivity (0.614) and the lowest false discovery rate (0.067). The automated detector had the highest sensitivity (0.921) and the highest false discovery rate (0.919). All methods generated under one false report per day. There were no fall detection-related adverse events. Conclusion Fall calendars likely underestimate fall frequency by around 40%. The automated detector evaluated here misses very few falls but likely overestimates the number of falls by around one fall per day. Additional research is needed to produce an ideal fall detection and counting method for use in clinical and research applications.

This paper presents the possibility of using accelerometric data to optimise deep learning convolutional neural network systems to distinguish between ataxic and normal gait. The experimental dataset includes 860 signal segments of 16 ataxic patients and 19 individuals from the control set with the mean age of 38.6 and 39.6 years, respectively. The proposed methodology is based upon the analysis of frequency components of accelerometric signals simultaneously recorded at specific body positions with a sampling frequency of 60 Hz. The deep learning system uses all of the frequency components in a range of (0,30) Hz. Our classification results are compared with those obtained by standard methods, which include the support vector machine, Bayesian methods, and the two-layer neural network with features estimated as the relative power in selected frequency bands. Our results show that the appropriate selection of sensor positions can increase the accuracy from 81.2% for the foot position to 91.7% for the spine position. Combining the input data and the deep learning methodology with five layers increased the accuracy to 95.8%. Our methodology suggests that artificial intelligence methods and deep learning are efficient methods in the assessment of motion disorders and they have a wide range of further applications.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3185675993","numberInSourceReferences":252,"doi":"10.1016/J.MSARD.2021.103164","title":"MSCopilot: New smartphone-based digital biomarkers correlate with Expanded Disability Status Scale scores in people with Multiple Sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Ian-Christopher Tanoh","orcid":null,"LN":"Tanoh","FN":"Ian-Christopher","affil":"Computer Science Laboratory of the École Polytechnique (FR)","name":"Ian-Christopher Tanoh"},{"id":"Elisabeth Maillart","orcid":"0000-0001-7699-0328","LN":"Maillart","FN":"Elisabeth","affil":"Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital (FR)","name":"Elisabeth Maillart"},{"id":"Pierre Labauge","orcid":null,"LN":"Labauge","FN":"Pierre","affil":"University Hospital of Montpellier (FR)","name":"Pierre Labauge"},{"id":"Mikael Cohen","orcid":"0000-0002-3985-1297","LN":"Cohen","FN":"Mikael","affil":"Department of Neurology, Nice University Hospital, Nice, France.","name":"Mikael Cohen"},{"id":"Adil Maarouf","orcid":null,"LN":"Maarouf","FN":"Adil","affil":"Aix-Marseille University (FR), Center for Magnetic Resonance in Biology and Medicine (FR)","name":"Adil Maarouf"},{"id":"Sandra Vukusic","orcid":null,"LN":"Vukusic","FN":"Sandra","affil":"Hospices Civils de Lyon (FR)","name":"Sandra Vukusic"},{"id":"Cécile Donzé","orcid":null,"LN":"Donzé","FN":"Cécile","affil":"Groupe Hospitalier de l'Institut Catholique de Lille (FR)","name":"Cécile Donzé"},{"id":"Philippe Gallien","orcid":null,"LN":"Gallien","FN":"Philippe","affil":"Physical Rehabilitation Medicine, Pôle Saint Helier, Rennes, France.","name":"Philippe Gallien"},{"id":"Jérôme De Seze","orcid":null,"LN":"Seze","FN":"Jérôme De","affil":"Hôpital Civil, Strasbourg (FR)","name":"Jérôme De Seze"},{"id":"Bertrand Bourre","orcid":"0000-0002-2459-2480","LN":"Bourre","FN":"Bertrand","affil":"University of Rouen (FR)","name":"Bertrand Bourre"},{"id":"Thibault Moreau","orcid":null,"LN":"Moreau","FN":"Thibault","affil":"Maison des Sciences de l’Homme de Dijon (FR)","name":"Thibault Moreau"},{"id":"Céline Louapre","orcid":"0000-0002-4987-1531","LN":"Louapre","FN":"Céline","affil":"Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital (FR)","name":"Céline Louapre"},{"id":"Morgane Vallée","orcid":null,"LN":"Vallée","FN":"Morgane","affil":"Institut du Cerveau (FR), Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital (FR)","name":"Morgane Vallée"},{"id":"S.

We conducted further analyses to assess MSCopilot's performance with respect to the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Methods The data of 116 PwMS were analysed. We studied the correlations between MSCopilot scores and the EDSS, and their ability to distinguish PwMS with high and low EDSS through a study of the distribution of the digital test scores as well as logistic regression models. The same analyses were performed using the MSFC tests. Results MSCopilot composite scores were as highly correlated to the EDSS (|r| = 0.65, p < 0.01) as their MSFC counterparts, confirming the known correlation of the MSFC with the EDSS. In a linear regression framework, the Walking digital tests have good explanatory power, especially for PwMS with EDSS > 3.5 (R²adj=0.47). The mean values of each MSCopilot subscore were significantly different between patients with an EDSS > 3.5 and others (p < 0.05), which could not be proved for the MSFC Cognition tests. MSCopilot4 was the best model to predict an EDSS score > 3.5 (AUC = 0.92). Conclusion These analyses confirm the reliability of MSCopilot and show interesting correlations with the EDSS (similar results obtained with the MSFC). MSCopilot was able to highlight nuances in the different stages of MS the MSFC could not capture.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W3047269081","numberInSourceReferences":179,"doi":"10.3390/S20154329","title":"Sensorized Tip for Monitoring People with Multiple Sclerosis that Require Assistive Devices for Walking","authors":[{"id":"Asier Brull","orcid":null,"LN":"Brull","FN":"Asier","affil":"University of the Basque Country (ES)","name":"Asier Brull"},{"id":"Asier Zubizarreta","orcid":null,"LN":"Zubizarreta","FN":"Asier","affil":"University of the Basque Country (ES)","name":"Asier Zubizarreta"},{"id":"Itziar Cabanes","orcid":null,"LN":"Cabanes","FN":"Itziar","affil":"University of the Basque Country (ES)","name":"Itziar Cabanes"},{"id":"Ana Rodriguez-Larrad","orcid":"0000-0003-0923-0788","LN":"Rodriguez-Larrad","FN":"Ana","affil":"University of the Basque Country (ES)","name":"Ana Rodriguez-Larrad"}],"year":2020,"journal":"Sensors","references":["W1596394795","W1951099728","W1965886101","W1968001249","W1982848437","W1984665577","W1995291524","W2020496717","W2028842616","W2036793523","W2042494021","W2055218956","W2066564455","W2068188331","W2110615873","W2112165124","W2119408292","W2122102074","W2129185250","W2129793335","W2141318231","W2170085298","W2170931123","W2343169648","W2465124479","W2538950955","W2736848666","W2791059914","W2895595440","W2896071522","W2942000095","W2970189584","W3150509498"],"citationsCount":4,"abstract":"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a neurological degenerative disease with high impact on our society.

In this work, a novel Sensorized Tip is proposed for monitoring People with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) that require Assistive Devices for Walking (ADW) such as canes or crutches. The developed Sensorized Tip can be adapted to the personal ADW of each patient to reduce its impact, and provides sensor data while naturally walking in the everyday activities.

Gait impairment is a common finding in MS, one caused by several neurological symptoms. We perform an event-specific analysis to study the variable impact of MS on gait components. Our results show that the mid-swing to heel strike (HS) phase of a gait cycle is the most indicative of motor problems. We apply the Hilbert-Huang transform to inertial gait data, corresponding to this phase, to extract the spectral features and study their relationships with the patient-reported outcomes. A number of strong and statistically significant dependencies were found, many having to do with activities of daily living and MS walking scale, leading to the conclusion that the disturbance in mid-swing to HS is specific to deterioration in physical functions. Spearman correlations coefficients and adjusted R2 obtained using stepwise linear regression models are reported. We conclude that event-specific gait features can be used to quantify the precise impact of MS symptoms on gait phases and identify markers of balance, stability, or fall risk, etc. We believe that this information supplements on-going MS research and could be used to develop personalized disease-modifying therapies and exercises.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2339597857","numberInSourceReferences":113,"doi":"10.1177/1352458515622695","title":"Prolonged-release fampridine in multiple sclerosis: Improved ambulation effected by changes in walking pattern","authors":[{"id":"Björn Zörner","orcid":null,"LN":"Zörner","FN":"Björn","affil":"University Hospital of Zurich (CH)","name":"Björn Zörner"},{"id":"Linard Filli","orcid":"0000-0003-3882-2504","LN":"Filli","FN":"Linard","affil":"University Hospital of Zurich (CH)","name":"Linard Filli"},{"id":"Katja Reuter","orcid":"0000-0002-1559-9058","LN":"Reuter","FN":"Katja","affil":"University Hospital of Zurich (CH)","name":"Katja Reuter"},{"id":"Sandra Kapitza","orcid":null,"LN":"Kapitza","FN":"Sandra","affil":"University Hospital of Zurich (CH)","name":"Sandra Kapitza"},{"id":"Lilla Lörincz","orcid":null,"LN":"Lörincz","FN":"Lilla","affil":"University Hospital of Zurich (CH)","name":"Lilla Lörincz"},{"id":"Tabea Sutter","orcid":null,"LN":"Sutter","FN":"Tabea","affil":"University Hospital of Zurich (CH)","name":"Tabea Sutter"},{"id":"David Weller","orcid":null,"LN":"Weller","FN":"David","affil":"University Hospital of Zurich (CH)","name":"David Weller"},{"id":"Melinda Farkas","orcid":null,"LN":"Farkas","FN":"Melinda","affil":"Biogen (CH)","name":"Melinda Farkas"},{"id":"Christopher S.

Our aim was to assess the potential role of the cerebellum and brain stem structures in the generation of MS tremor.We performed accelerometric (ACC) and electromyographic(EMG) assessment of tremor in 32MS patients with manual clumsiness. In addition to clinical examination, patients underwent a neurophysiological exploration of the brainstem and cerebellar functions,which consisted of blink and masseter inhibitory reflexes, cerebello-thalamo-cortical inhibition (CTCi), and somatosensory evoked potentials. Tremor was clinically visible in 18 patients and absent in 14. Patients with visible tremor had more severe score of ataxia and clinical signs of cerebellar dysfunction, as well as a more reduced CTCi on neurophysiological investigation. However, ACC and EMG recordings confirmed the presence of a real rhythmic activity in only one patient. In most MS patients, the clinically visible tremor corresponded to a pseudorhythmic activity without coupling between ACC and EMG recordings. Cerebellar dysfunction may contribute to the occurrence of this pseudorhythmic activity mimicking tremor during posture and movement execution.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2158910944","numberInSourceReferences":44,"doi":"10.1155/2012/868256","title":"Weight Status in Persons with Multiple Sclerosis: Implications for Mobility Outcomes","authors":[{"id":"Lara A.

The sensors were placed on anatomical segments of the lower limb: foot, shank, thigh, and hip, and the motion data were then captured in conjunction with 3D ground reaction forces (GRFs). The method of relational matrix was applied to develop a rule-based system, an intelligent fuzzy computational algorithm. The rule-based system provides a feature matrix model representing the strength of association or interaction amongst the elements of the gait functions (limb-segments accelerations and GRFs) throughout the gait cycle. A comparison between the reference rule-based data and an input test data was evaluated using a fuzzy similarity algorithm. This system was tested and evaluated using two subject groups: 10 healthy subjects were recruited to establish the reference fuzzy rule-base, and 4 relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis subjects were used as an input test data; and the grade of similarity between them was evaluated. This similarity provides a quantitative assessment of mobility state of the impaired subject. This algorithmic tool may be helpful to the clinician in the identification of pathological gait impairments, prescribe treatment, and assess the improvements in response to therapeutic intervention.","isRetracted":false}],"incomingSuggestions":[{"id":"W2112165124","numberInSourceReferences":1,"doi":"10.1212/WNL.33.11.1444","title":"Rating neurologic impairment in multiple sclerosis: An expanded disability status scale (EDSS)","authors":[{"id":"John F.

To assess the correlation of 6MW to subjective measures of fatigue, health status and ambulation using the modified fatigue impact scale (MFIS), short form-36 Health Questionnaire physical component score and MS walking scale (MSWS). Methods Forty MS expanded disability status scale [(EDSS) 0—6.5] and 20 control subjects were recruited from a MS outpatient clinic. Subjects completed survey material and three 6MWs with 1-h interval rest in a single study visit. Results There was no practice effect or fatigability with repeat 6MW tests with a one-h rest period between test sessions. The 6MW had excellent intra-[intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.95] and inter-rater (ICC = 0.91) reliability. MS subjects demonstrated reduced 6MW distance and speed compared with controls ( P &lt; 0.0001). Within the MS population 6MW distance was significantly reduced with increasing disability ( P = 0.05). Compared with the EDSS, the 6MW had a stronger correlation to subjective measures of ambulation and physical fatigue: MSWS ( r = -0.81 versus 0.69) and MFISphy (0.66 versus 0.63). Conclusions The 6MW is a feasible, reproducible, and reliable measure in MS. MS subjects demonstrate motor fatigue in both 6MW distance and speed compared with controls. In MS subjects there is an inverse relationship between motor fatigue and disability. 6MW has a strong correlation to subjective measures of ambulation and physical fatigue.

In clinical practice, the World Health Organization international classification of functioning (ICF)2 is often adopted as the underlying framework for the assessment of mobility, which is an individual's ability to move about effectively in their environment.2 The ICF also introduces the constructs of performance (what an individual does in his environment) and capacity (ability to execute a task or action). This has a clear impact on the current methodology for the assessment of mobility.\n\nDifferent pathologies and impairments culminate in abnormal or reduced walking. For instance, in multiple sclerosis (MS), impairments such as weakness and spasticity from pyramidal tract lesions, loss of proprioception and co-ordination from dorsal column and cerebellar lesions, vestibular and visual dysfunction, cognitive and mood disturbance and pain may all contribute (Figure 1). In primary muscle disease, mobility is determined by weakness but secondary factors such as weight gain, contractures, fatigue and breathlessness may have important impacts. The degree of impairment has a non-linear relationship with activity and participation. For example leg strength and walking speed are poorly correlated,3 while many personal and environmental factors may influence the impact of similar degrees of loss of walking on mobility. Figure 1. \nFramework of international classification of function (ICF) as illustrated by mobility in MS.\n\n\n\nImpaired walking can be a marker of both disability and disease progression, and is therefore an important outcome measure in the treatment and rehabilitation of diseases such as MS and Parkinson's disease (PD). In some cases, measurement of mobility may have a direct influence on access to treatment. … \n\nAddress correspondence to Dr O.R.

The pyramidal MS group walked with reduced speed ( P=0.03) and stride length ( P=0.04), and prolonged double limb support ( P=0.01), compared to the non-pyramidal group. Both MS groups demonstrated concomitant balance impairment, performing poorly on the Functional Reach Test compared to the control group ( P&lt;0.05).

Among the respondents 49% reported mild to severe pain and 49% of those indicated severe pain. Increased pain intensity was positively associated with gender (more women), multiple pain sites (51% of the severe pain group reported four or more pain sites), and constancy of pain (44% among the group with severe pain). There was also a positive association with increased MS-related disability, relapsing-worsening type of MS, and depression. Respondents with severe pain made greater use of the healthcare system and of prescribed analgesics, but were less likely to be satisfied with their doctors' efforts to manage their pain. About one-third of the patients with moderate pain and 18% of those with severe pain reported no consultations for their pain. The effects of pain severity were fully evident in the respondents' daily life, their work, mood, recreational activities and enjoyment of life. Our results indicate that the high prevalence of MS-related severe pain, low satisfaction with management of intense pain, and the perceived interference with quality of life indicators necessitate greater attention by healthcare providers to the management of pain and uncomfortable sensations in the MS population.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2142577589","numberInSourceReferences":12,"doi":"10.1159/000367614","title":"New Multiple Sclerosis Phenotypic Classification","authors":[{"id":"A4355373149","orcid":null,"LN":"Lublin","FN":"Fred D.","affil":"Icahn School of Medicine, Corinne Goldsmith Dickinson Center for Multiple Sclerosis, Mount Sinai, New York, N.Y., USA."}],"year":2014,"journal":"European Neurology","references":["W2046941822","W2087589796","W2105206040","W2107008240","W2122545833"],"citations":[],"citationsCount":3084,"abstract":"In 1996, the clinical course of multiple sclerosis (MS) was characterized as relapsing-remitting, primary progressive, secondary progressive or progressive relapsing. Since then, an increased understanding of MS and its pathology prompted a re-examination of these clinical phenotypes. Main recommendations of the 2013 revisions are provided herein.Clinically isolated syndrome has been added, and progressive relapsing MS has been eliminated, from the clinical course descriptions. All forms of MS should be further subcategorized as either active or non-active. Active MS is defined as the occurrence of clinical relapse or the presence of new T2 or gadolinium-enhancing lesions over a specified period of time, preferably at least one year. An additional subcategory for patients with progressive MS differentiates between those who have shown signs of disability progression over a given time period and those who have remained stable. The term 'worsening' is recommended to describe patients whose disease is advancing for any reason, whereas 'disease progression' should be reserved for those with progressive disease who are truly progressing (as opposed to worsening from a relapse). The term 'benign' should be used with caution as the course of MS can worsen at any time, even after many years of apparent stability. Key Messages: Newer characterizations of MS phenotypes include a consideration of disease activity (based on the clinical relapse rate and imaging findings) and disease progression. Accurate clinical course descriptions are useful for communication, prognostication, clinical trial design and to guide everyday clinical decision-making.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2114242035","numberInSourceReferences":11,"doi":"10.1001/ARCHNEUR.1989.00520460115022","title":"The Fatigue Severity Scale","authors":[{"id":"A4358649502","orcid":null,"LN":"Krupp","FN":"Lauren B.","affil":"Stony Brook University (US), State University of New York (US)"},{"id":"A4336229032","orcid":null,"LN":"LaRocca","FN":"Nicholas G.","affil":"Albert Einstein College of Medicine (US)"},{"id":"A2164359925","orcid":null,"LN":"Muir-Nash","FN":"Joanne","affil":"National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (US)"},{"id":"A4334843220","orcid":null,"LN":"Steinberg","FN":"Alfred D.","affil":"National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (US)"}],"year":1989,"journal":"Archives of neurology","references":["W42114613","W152150752","W1964403364","W2064687595","W2075427186","W2112778345","W2138995305","W2146203649","W2176880214"],"citations":[],"citationsCount":4465,"abstract":"Fatigue is a prominent disabling symptom in a variety of medical and neurologic disorders. To facilitate research in this area, we developed a fatigue severity scale, subjected it to tests of internal consistency and validity, and used it to compare fatigue in two chronic conditions: systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis. Administration of the fatigue severity scale to 25 patients with multiple sclerosis, 29 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, and 20 healthy adults revealed that the fatigue severity scale was internally consistent, correlated well with visual analogue measures, clearly differentiated controls from patients, and could detect clinically predicted changes in fatigue over time. Fatigue had a greater deleterious impact on daily living in patients with multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus compared with controls. The results further showed that fatigue was largely independent of self-reported depressive symptoms and that several characteristics could differentiate fatigue that accompanies multiple sclerosis from fatigue that accompanies systemic lupus erythematosus. This study demonstrates (1) the clinical and research applications of a scale that measures fatigue severity and (2) helps to identify features that distinguish fatigue between two chronic medical disorders.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2145481931","numberInSourceReferences":13,"doi":"10.1177/1352458508088916","title":"Patient perception of bodily functions in multiple sclerosis: gait and visual function are the most valuable","authors":[{"id":"A2080242976","orcid":"0000-0001-8131-9467","LN":"Heesen","FN":"Christoph","affil":"Institute of Neuroimmunology and Clinical MS Research, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany."},{"id":"A4336219449","orcid":null,"LN":"Böhm","FN":"Johannes","affil":"Institute of Neuroimmunology and Clinical MS Research (INiMS), University Medical Center Hamburg‐Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany"},{"id":"A4345878355","orcid":null,"LN":"Reich","FN":"Christian","affil":"Competenzzentrum Versorgungsforschung in der Dermatologie (CVderm), University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany"},{"id":"A4358142066","orcid":null,"LN":"Kasper","FN":"Justin C.","affil":"Department of Health Sciences, University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany"},{"id":"A4337957976","orcid":null,"LN":"Goebel","FN":"M.","affil":"Institute of Neuroimmunology and Clinical MS Research (INiMS), University Medical Center Hamburg‐Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany"},{"id":"A4342302338","orcid":null,"LN":"Gold","FN":"Steven H.","affil":"Multiple Sclerosis Program, Department of Neurology and Cousins Center for Psychoneuroimmunology, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA"}],"year":2008,"journal":"Multiple Sclerosis Journal","references":["W1996480774","W2034417379","W2061343308","W2080896710","W2087086140","W2104878804","W2125053316","W2129612740","W2130355701","W2139643164","W2154514379"],"citations":[],"citationsCount":432,"abstract":"Multiple sclerosis is a heterogeneous disease with varying clinical picture.

Shorter timed walking tests (Timed 25-foot Walk (T25FW), 10-metre Timed Walk, 30-metre Timed Walk) measure overall walking disability and are best suited for clinical settings, whereas longer timed or distance tests (100-metre Timed Walk, 6-minute Walk Test, 2-minute Walk Test) are better for the assessment of walking fatigability, distance limitations and functional capacity. The MSWS-12 measures different, but related, aspects of walking than the objective tests. The T25FW is the best characterised objective measure of walking disability and can be used across a wide range of walking disabilities.

However, it is not clear if these abnormalities can be detected with clinically feasible technology. This investigation examined if the spatiotemporal markers of gait including variability metrics can distinguish between PwMS with minimal disability and controls with clinically feasible technology. 43 PwMS with minimal disability and 43 healthy controls completed four walking trials along a 26 foot long pressure sensitive pathway (GAITRite). Spatiotemporal markers of gait including variability metrics were determined. Statistical analysis revealed that PwMS walked slower, with fewer, shorter, wider steps and spent a greater percentage of a gait cycle in double support than controls. Additionally, PwMS had greater variability in the time between steps, single support percent and step width than controls. Collectively, the results highlight that PwMS, in the absence of clinical gait impairment, have subtle but detectable differences in gait and that these alterations can be detected with clinically feasible technology. The current results raise the possibility of targeting walking deviations earlier in disability progression in PwMS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2150378783","numberInSourceReferences":17,"doi":"10.1177/135245859900500409","title":"The Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite measure (MSFC): an integrated approach to MS clinical outcome assessment","authors":[{"id":"A4357055972","orcid":null,"LN":"Fischer","FN":"Julia","affil":"Cleveland Clinic (US)"},{"id":"A4348940841","orcid":null,"LN":"Rudick","FN":"Richard A.","affil":"Medicine"},{"id":"A4353178856","orcid":null,"LN":"Cutter","FN":"Gary","affil":"Cancer Research Center (US)"},{"id":"A4341826093","orcid":null,"LN":"Reingold","FN":"Stephen C.","affil":"National Multiple Sclerosis Society (US)"}],"year":1999,"journal":"Multiple Sclerosis Journal","references":["W32267339","W1937911740","W2000399989","W2002899906","W2008739030","W2017381757","W2032018514","W2036581929","W2040917709","W2080896710","W2081520990","W2091683461","W2104878804","W2112165124","W2139367012","W2151529161","W2167365151","W2314521502"],"citations":[],"citationsCount":787,"abstract":"Clinical outcome assessment in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is challenging due to the diversity and fluctuating nature of MS symptoms. Traditional clinical scales such as the EDSS are inadequate in their assessment of key clinical dimensions of MS (e.g., cognitive function), and they have psychometric limitations as well. Based on analyses of pooled data from natural history studies and from placebo groups in clinical trials, the National MS Society's Clinical Outcomes Assessment Task Force recently proposed a new multidimensional clinical outcome measure, the MS Functional Composite (MSFC). The MSFC comprises quantitative functional measures of three key clinical dimensions of MS: leg function/ambulation, arm/hand function, and cognitive function. Scores on component measures are converted to standard scores (z-scores), which are averaged to form a single MSFC score. Preliminary analyses confirm that: (1) the three clinical dimensions of the MSFC are relatively independent; (2) the MSFC is sensitive to clinical changes over 1- and 2-year intervals; and (3) the MSFC has acceptable criterion validity (i.e., predicts both concurrent and subsequent EDSS change). The advantages and potential limitations of incorporating quantitative functional outcome measures such as the MSFC into collaborative databases are discussed.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2158156478","numberInSourceReferences":18,"doi":"10.1146/ANNUREV.NEURO.30.051606.094313","title":"Multiple Sclerosis: An Immune or Neurodegenerative Disorder?","authors":[{"id":"A4344314395","orcid":null,"LN":"Trapp","FN":"Bruce D.","affil":"Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine (US)"},{"id":"A4357713123","orcid":null,"LN":"Nave","FN":"Klaus-Armin","affil":"Max Planck Institute of Experimental Medicine (DE), Max Planck Society (DE)"}],"year":2008,"journal":"Annual Review of Neuroscience","references":["W16252708","W269268367","W1270085290","W1500818454","W1514064771","W1547957565","W1565999785","W1575041997","W1631348406","W1887462983","W1933220919","W1937650001","W1969290948","W1970547229","W1974366107","W1976329033","W1979515209","W1982191203","W1983925588","W1985115385","W1986464758","W1988586000","W1994009925","W1994469616","W1995643379","W1997024092","W1997621686","W2000485285","W2007769881","W2008501843","W2009034058","W2022050192","W2023385152","W2032830205","W2036164613","W2037965052","W2043613949","W2048761398","W2049116186","W2050348658","W2050974084","W2052644415","W2060129459","W2063514287","W2065306834","W2067200113","W2067496000","W2068599327","W2070687292","W2072234477","W2078161600","W2079982783","W2082438248","W2082688434","W2085730152","W2088114438","W2089917631","W2097669496","W2099185169","W2099647077","W2100290637","W2102532330","W2102993505","W2103029732","W2103758700","W2105490558","W2105548401","W2109015752","W2109271830","W2111480581","W2113101274","W2113945911","W2114091391","W2115531983","W2116064638","W2116547716","W2118637799","W2118917448","W2121980121","W2122587876","W2123046122","W2123525386","W2124017577","W2124770605","W2126968890","W2127671643","W2131209622","W2131851074","W2132228594","W2132724157","W2136019899","W2136325849","W2137495383","W2137911312","W2139066937","W2139367012","W2139843103","W2143122654","W2143683874","W2144153615","W2144276354","W2146523233","W2146702689","W2146853725","W2147062889","W2147467901","W2148563799","W2148631447","W2154025261","W2156779938","W2160413407","W2161234073","W2162489621","W2162705189","W2164392039","W2164721910","W2165547142","W2169098250","W2171398944","W2171556560","W2206400534","W2316145923","W2321125363","W2325038063","W2495519788","W2527832785","W2916040650","W3026077775","W4241890711","W4242191995","W4248326606","W4250145052"],"citations":[],"citationsCount":1386,"abstract":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory-mediated demyelinating disease of the human central nervous system.

One of the MSOAC goals is acceptance and qualification by regulators of performance outcomes that are highly reliable and valid, practical, cost-effective, and meaningful in MS. This article addresses the history, application, and psychometric properties of one such MSOAC metric of ambulation or walking namely, the timed 25-foot walk (T25FW). The T25FW has strong reliability over both brief and long periods of time in MS across a large range of disability levels. The outcome of walking speed from the T25FW has obvious real-world relevance and has correlated strongly with other measures of walking and lower extremity function. The T25FW is responsive for capturing intervention effects in pharmacological and rehabilitation trials and has an established value for capturing clinically meaningful change in ambulation. Directions for future research involve validating clinically meaningful improvements on the T25FW as well as determining whether 20% change is clinically meaningful across the disability spectrum. Researchers might further consider synchronizing accelerometers and motion sensors with the T25FW for capturing walking speed in everyday life and the patient’s real environment.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W1995110505","numberInSourceReferences":20,"doi":"10.1177/1756285610374117","title":"Possible clinical outcome measures for clinical trials in patients with multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"A4351668718","orcid":null,"LN":"Goldman","FN":"Myla D.","affil":"University of Virginia (US)"},{"id":"A4355031099","orcid":null,"LN":"Motl","FN":"Robert W.","affil":"University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (US)"},{"id":"A4348940841","orcid":null,"LN":"Rudick","FN":"Richard A.","affil":"Medicine"}],"year":2010,"journal":"Therapeutic Advances in Neurological Disorders","references":["W1964281035","W1966830462","W1967990636","W1968526916","W1968656445","W1971280658","W1977768965","W1979799127","W1979835871","W1982564517","W1988160865","W1996492382","W1998966159","W2004752476","W2005506388","W2006884670","W2007010216","W2012040225","W2013086655","W2015526949","W2017489920","W2018916361","W2019582599","W2022850051","W2026877602","W2027126421","W2028664517","W2030705485","W2035282943","W2039351270","W2040917709","W2042777359","W2046941822","W2048018021","W2050824693","W2052851142","W2055479283","W2056736742","W2061005334","W2061268385","W2064687595","W2070532347","W2080896710","W2087589796","W2091683461","W2095102633","W2095314460","W2098217376","W2101000495","W2103758700","W2103931528","W2104878804","W2107008240","W2107499730","W2112165124","W2113922021","W2114060341","W2114242035","W2118277450","W2119629949","W2121149730","W2122347629","W2123359871","W2125053316","W2126737632","W2129612740","W2139344244","W2139367012","W2141021670","W2141062585","W2143567192","W2145481931","W2147062889","W2150378783","W2154796168","W2155194814","W2161634194","W2164765179","W2167790027","W2168089704","W2169098250","W2170130021","W2326826867","W3021650060","W4210548604","W4210933644","W4238758202","W4241891081","W4245279901"],"citations":[],"citationsCount":115,"abstract":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease with both clinical and pathological heterogeneity.

Methods for measuring PA are diverse and the impact of this heterogeneity on study outcomes is unclear. We aimed to clarify this impact by comparing common methods for deriving PA metrics in MS populations.First, a rapid review of existing literature identified methods for calculating PA in studies which used the Actigraph GT3X in populations with MS. We then compared methods in a prospective study on 42 persons with MS [EDSS 4.5 (3.5-6)] during a voluntary course of inpatient neurorehabilitation. Mixed-effects linear regression identified methodological factors which influenced PA measurements. Non-parametric hypothesis tests, correlations, and agreement statistics assessed overall and pairwise differences between methods.In the rapid review, searches identified 421 unique records. Sixty-nine records representing 51 eligible studies exhibited substantial heterogeneity in methodology and reporting practices. In a subsequent comparative study, multiple methods for deriving six PA metrics (step count, activity counts, total time in PA, sedentary time, time in light PA, time in moderate to vigorous PA), were identified and directly compared. All metrics were sensitive to methodological factors such as the selected preprocessing filter, data source (vertical vs. vector magnitude counts), and cutpoint. Additionally, sedentary time was sensitive to wear time definitions. Pairwise correlation and agreement between methods varied from weak (minimum correlation: 0.15, minimum agreement: 0.03) to perfect (maximum correlation: 1.00, maximum agreement: 1.00). Methodological factors biased both point estimates of PA and correlations between PA and clinical assessments.Methodological heterogeneity of existing literature is high, and this heterogeneity may confound studies which use the Actigraph GT3X. Step counts were highly sensitive to the filter used to process raw accelerometer data. Sedentary time was particularly sensitive to methodology, and we recommend using total time in PA instead. Several, though not all, methods for deriving light PA and moderate to vigorous PA yielded nearly identical results. PA metrics based on vertical axis counts tended to outperform those based on vector magnitude counts. Additional research is needed to establish the relative validity of existing methods.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2342870422","numberInSourceReferences":2,"doi":"10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0154335","title":"Remote Physical Activity Monitoring in Neurological Disease: A Systematic Review","authors":[{"id":"Valerie J Block","orcid":null,"LN":"Block","FN":"Valerie J","affil":"University of California, San Francisco (US), San Francisco State University (US)","name":"Valerie J Block"},{"id":"Erica A.

Studies that measured only involuntary motor activity (tremor, seizures), energy expenditure or sleep were excluded. Feasibility, findings, and protocols were examined.137 studies met inclusion criteria in multiple sclerosis (MS) (61 studies); stroke (41); Parkinson's Disease (PD) (20); dementia (11); traumatic brain injury (2) and ataxia (1). Physical activity levels measured by remote monitoring are consistently low in people with MS, stroke and dementia, and patterns of physical activity are altered in PD. In MS, decreased ambulatory activity assessed via remote monitoring is associated with greater disability and lower quality of life. In stroke, remote measures of upper limb function and ambulation are associated with functional recovery following rehabilitation and goal-directed interventions. In PD, remote monitoring may help to predict falls. In dementia, remote physical activity measures correlate with disease severity and can detect wandering.These studies show that remote physical activity monitoring is feasible in neurological diseases, including in people with moderate to severe neurological disability. Remote monitoring can be a psychometrically sound and responsive way to assess physical activity in neurological disease. Further research is needed to ensure these tools provide meaningful information in the context of specific neurological disorders and patterns of neurological disability.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2756570429","numberInSourceReferences":3,"doi":"10.1080/17434440.2017.1386550","title":"Motion sensors in multiple sclerosis: Narrative review and update of applications","authors":[{"id":"Jeffer Eidi Sasaki","orcid":null,"LN":"Sasaki","FN":"Jeffer Eidi","affil":"University of Alabama at Birmingham (US)","name":"Jeffer Eidi Sasaki"},{"id":"Brian M.

Areas covered: This manuscript reviews the literature regarding the application of motion sensors for measuring physical activity in MS. We first describe 'what is known' about their use in MS by examining the evidence generated between 1997 and 2012, including the psychometric properties of motion sensors in MS and the development of MS-specific accelerometer cut-points. We then evaluate 'what is new' based on research conducted between 2013 and 2017. This includes newer research on psychometric properties of motion sensors in MS, development of new MS-specific accelerometer and step-rate cut-points, sedentary behavior assessment, and research on fitness trackers and multisensors in MS. The final part presents a picture of 'what is next' for the applications of motion sensors in MS, especially pertaining new opportunities for testing and using fitness trackers in MS, and tracking disease and disability progression based on motion sensor output. Expert commentary: The use of motion sensors in MS has grown substantially over the years; however, a lot more can be done to explore the full potential and utility of these devices in MS.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2792809807","numberInSourceReferences":4,"doi":"10.1080/09638288.2018.1424956","title":"Use of the Godin leisure-time exercise questionnaire in multiple sclerosis research: a comprehensive narrative review","authors":[{"id":"Elizabeth Morghen Sikes","orcid":null,"LN":"Sikes","FN":"Elizabeth Morghen","affil":"University of Alabama at Birmingham (US)","name":"Elizabeth Morghen Sikes"},{"id":"Emma Richardson","orcid":null,"LN":"Richardson","FN":"Emma","affil":"University of Alabama at Birmingham (US)","name":"Emma Richardson"},{"id":"Katie L.J.

This paper provides a comprehensive description of its application and inclusion in research on physical activity in multiple sclerosis.This comprehensive, narrative review included papers that were published between 1985 and 2017, written in English, involved participants with multiple sclerosis as a primary population, measured physical activity, and cited one of the two original Godin papers.There is a broad scope of research that has included the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire in persons with multiple sclerosis. Overall, 8 papers evaluated its psychometric properties, 21 evaluated patterns of physical activity, 24 evaluated correlates or determinants of physical activity, 28 evaluated outcomes or consequences of physical activity, and 15 evaluated physical activity interventions. The Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire is a valid self-report measure of physical activity in persons with multiple sclerosis, and further is an appropriate, simple, and effective tool for describing patterns of physical activity, examining correlates and outcomes of physical activity, and provides a sensitive outcome for measuring change in physical activity after an intervention. Implications for rehabilitation There is increasing interest in physical activity and its benefits in multiple sclerosis. The study of physical activity requires appropriate and standardized measures. The Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire is a common self-report measure of physical activity for persons with multiple sclerosis. Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire scores are reliable measures of physical activity in persons with multiple sclerosis.

A systematic search of eight databases was conducted. Cohort and intervention studies which included an objective measure of PA were included. Objective PA outputs of steps per day and minutes of moderate-vigorous activity (MVPA) per day were extracted from the MS studies and the published NHANES dataset. Meta-analysis was used to compare the differences between the groups for these parametric outcomes. A general population sample from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) in the United States of America was used as a comparative group. The systematic search resulted in 32 papers (n = 2 randomized control trials, n = 30 cohort studies). A total of 3 762 pwMS were included. The sample was largely female (n = 3 118, 82.8%) and ambulatory with/without use of an aid (n = 31 studies). There were significant differences between the MS and the published NHANES comparative group with respect to 1) steps per day [mean difference: -3845 (-4120.17, -3569.83), P < .0001, n = 10 studies] and 2) minutes of MVPA per day [mean difference: 9.00 (-12.5, -5.4), P < .0001, n = 3 studies], indicating pwMS are less physically active than the NHANES sample.

A wearable biosensor not only has the potential to enhance physical exams, but also offers the promise of remote evaluations of the patient either at home or with local non-specialist providers. Areas covered: We performed a structured literature review on the use of wearable biosensors in studies of multiple sclerosis. This included accelerometers, gyroscopes, eye-trackers, grip sensors, and multi-sensors. Expert commentary: Wearable sensors that are sensitive to change in function over time have great potential to serve as outcome metrics in clinical trials. Key features of generalizability are simplicity in the application of the device and delivery of data to the provider. Another important feature to establish is best sampling rate. Having too high of a sampling rate can lead to over-interpretation of noisy data On the other hand, a low sampling rate can result in an insensitive test thus missing subtle changes of clinical interest. Of most importance is to establish metrics derived from wearable devices that provide meaningful data in longitudinal studies.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2112413713","numberInSourceReferences":8,"doi":"10.1586/ERN.12.74","title":"Commercially available accelerometry as an ecologically valid measure of ambulation in individuals with multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"Robert W.

The prevalence of walking impairment in people with MS (pwMS) is estimated between 41% and 75%. To evaluate the walking capacity in pwMS, the patient reported outcomes (PROs) and performance-based tests (i.e., the 2-minute walk test, the 6-minute walk test, the Timed 25-Foot Walk Test, the Timed Up and Go Test, and the Six Spot Step Test) could be used. However, some studies point out that the results of both performance-based tests and objective measures (i.e., by accelerometer) could not reflect patient reports of walking performance and impact of MS on daily life. This review analyses different motion sensors embedded in smartphones and motion wearable device (MWD) that can be useful to measure free-living walking behavior, to evaluate falls, fatigue, sedentary lifestyle, exercise, and quality of sleep in everyday life of pwMS. Caveats and limitations of MWD such as variable accuracy, user adherence, power consumption and recharging, noise susceptibility, and data management are discussed as well.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2597188996","numberInSourceReferences":12,"doi":"10.1080/17483107.2017.1297859","title":"Objective physical activity measurement in people with multiple sclerosis: a review of the literature","authors":[{"id":"A2315594493","orcid":"0000-0001-9086-1258","LN":"Casey","FN":"Blathin","affil":"University of Limerick (IE)"},{"id":"A4339868872","orcid":null,"LN":"Coote","FN":"Susan","affil":"University of Limerick (IE)"},{"id":"A4336896422","orcid":null,"LN":"Donnelly","FN":"Alan E.","affil":"University of Limerick (IE)"}],"year":2018,"journal":"Disability and Rehabilitation: Assistive Technology","references":["W1527181082","W1734274705","W1873321488","W1881895648","W1891102068","W1904453581","W1967860258","W1969147864","W1972126940","W1977671373","W1984246512","W1988746590","W1988970590","W1990507371","W2003951314","W2006161019","W2008166065","W2012932483","W2013753927","W2023119254","W2028910718","W2035526069","W2039542829","W2039648436","W2042590444","W2049197285","W2059251460","W2059449425","W2060699725","W2061178742","W2065731896","W2082956218","W2086414808","W2092276594","W2098217376","W2098421679","W2098450425","W2101077311","W2104582668","W2108707936","W2118409616","W2146042523","W2147702281","W2159230394","W2159896438","W2162991855","W2169482678","W2171253534","W2175013203","W2187477173","W2218585431"],"citations":[],"citationsCount":18,"abstract":"The purpose of this study is to identify the objective physical activity (PA) measurement tools and outputs that are used within Multiple Sclerosis (MS) literature.A systematic search strategy on eight databases (2000-2016) using keywords associated with MS and PA.This review includes 32 papers. Uni-axial accelerometers were the most popular objective PA tool in this review (68%). Pedometers (14%) and multi-sensor systems (3%) were the second and third most common. PA outputs included activity counts per day, steps per day, energy expenditure per day, minutes of moderate-vigorous PA (MVPA), minutes of light PA and daily dynamic activity. Both activity counts per day (n = 21 studies), and steps per day (n = 11 studies) were most commonly used representing 78%.Uni-axial accelerometers and pedometers are the most popular PA measurement tools used in MS literature. However, developments in the field mean that most new sensors are tri-axial, and multi-sensor systems are also available. Researchers should use devices with published validation information, and should utilize the detail on activity patterns available from accelerometer measurement instead of expressing a single unit such as activity counts or step counts per day. Attention to capturing the duration, frequency, intensity and energy expended during daily PA is warranted. Implications for Rehabilitation The review reports that accelerometers were the research tool most frequently reported in the literature, though there were differences in device type and in how activity data was extracted from the stored information. The majority of research studies of physical activity levels in Multiple Sclerosis fail to provide an adequate range of activity outcomes, frequently using outcomes which do not allow simple cross-comparisons with other populations.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2972021237","numberInSourceReferences":14,"doi":"10.1007/S11910-019-0997-9","title":"Next Steps in Wearable Technology and

To date, several studies have examined PA in pwMS during daily life, but little is known about PA levels in pwMS during a rehabilitation period. The present study investigated PA levels (daily steps, light physical activity (LPA), and moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA)) in inpatient and outpatients with MS during their rehabilitation period and described the relationship between objectively measured PA and levels of disability, quality of life, fatigue, and self-efficacy. <h3>Methods</h3> In this exploratory cross-sectional study, we examined 40 pwMS during their inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation regime. Participants included in the study (<i>N</i> = 34) wore a Fitbit Versa tracker for one week recording daily steps, minutes of LPA, and minutes of MVPA (primary outcomes). They underwent a clinical assessment of physical activity levels (Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire(GLTEQ)), fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale(FSS)), walking ability (10 Meter Walk Test(10MWT), 2-Min Walk Test(2MWT), 12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking scale(MSWS-12)), quality of life (12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12)), and self-efficacy (Self-Efficacy in Multiple Sclerosis scale (SEMS)) (secondary outcomes). Multiple linear regressions (MLR) models were used to test whether the demographic difference between the two groups influenced the estimation of objective variables measured by Fitbit. Finally, correlations between objectively measured physical activity and subjective clinical scales were estimated with Spearman correlations. <h3>Results</h3> Our sample consisted of 21 females and 13 males with a mean (interquartile range) age of 52 (20) years and an Expanded Disability Status scale(EDSS) score of 6.0 (1.50) points; baseline characteristics of inpatients (<i>N</i> = 18) and outpatients (<i>N</i> = 16) differed statistically only in EDSS levels (<i>p</i>-value = 0.008) and use of assistive devices (p=0.007). The whole sample performed (mean±standard deviation) 3969±2190 steps per day, with no significant difference between inpatients (3318±1515) and outpatients (4660±2606). No statistical difference was found between the groups in LPA (p-value=0.064). A significant difference in MVPA (<i>p</i>-value < 0.001) was found between inpatients and outpatients, 1.52±3.98 and 14.69±11.56 min per day, respectively. Significant correlations were found between FSS and MVPA both in the whole sample (r(32)= -0.62, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and in the outpatients group (r(14) = -0.66, <i>p</i> = 0.005), and between 10MWT and daily steps (whole sample:(r(32) = 0.48, <i>p</i> = 0.005), outpatients:(r(14)= -0.51, <i>p</i> = 0.05)). <h3>Conclusions</h3> PwMS in our study overall engaged in reduced and less intense levels of daily PA with respect to the guidelines with inpatients performing almost no vigorous activities. Considering the importance of PA in improving physical and mental well-being, clinicians and researchers should develope strategies to increase daily PA of PwMS during their rehabilitation programs and daily life.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2896003349","numberInSourceReferences":17,"doi":"10.1080/14737175.2018.1533816","title":"Novel technology for mobility and balance tracking in patients with multiple sclerosis: a systematic review","authors":[{"id":"A4353608135","orcid":null,"LN":"Sun","FN":"Ruopeng","affil":"University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (US)"},{"id":"A4353269047","orcid":null,"LN":"McGinnis","FN":"Ryan S.","affil":"University of Vermont (US)"},{"id":"A4353913343","orcid":null,"LN":"Sosnoff","FN":"Jacob J.","affil":"University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (US)"}],"year":2018,"journal":"Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics","references":["W1952647236","W1969422637","W2001818617","W2006455433","W2008532656","W2013773236","W2021470828","W2026051200","W2027285375","W2039043944","W2061268385","W2061746076","W2080003981","W2082524174","W2091524510","W2108487302","W2112104974","W2143567192","W2156691412","W2157376692","W2161374186","W2164772540","W2165744315","W2179844194","W2341065564","W2341362536","W2467633427","W2496570214","W2504851880","W2543182432","W2586302922","W2592749504","W2593383909","W2593600099","W2620639087","W2623931409","W2740840999","W2744309171","W2748897565","W2752224735","W2780921219","W2782627175","W2789259524","W2791131333","W2791558592","W2794263969","W2801163157"],"citations":[],"citationsCount":14,"abstract":"Mobility and balance impairments in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) are major factors for decreased quality of life. Novel sensing technologies have great potential to efficiently capture subtle changes in mobility and balance performance, and thus improve current practices by providing an easy-to-implement, objective, and continuous functional tracking in MS population. Areas covered: This review details the collective findings of novel technology utilization in mobility and balance tracking in patients with MS. Thirty-three were systematically identified and included in this review. Pertinent methodological features (participant demographics, sensing technology, study aims, functional assessment protocols, and outcome measures) were extracted from each article. The construct validity, reliability, clinical relevance, and discriminative ability of sensor-based assessment in the MS population were summarized. Expert commentary: Sensor-based balance and mobility assessment are valid in comparison with reference standard techniques and are reliable to measure performance in the MS population. Sensor-based measures are also associated with validated clinical outcomes and are sensitive to functional deficits in individuals with MS. Such technologies may greatly improve the likelihood of detecting mobility and balance dysfunctions in real-world environments, thus allowing healthcare professionals to monitor interventions and manage disease progression precisely and efficiently Abbreviations: PwMS: Patients with Multiple Sclerosis; BBS: Berg Balance Scale; DGI: Dynamic Gait Index; ABC: Activity-specific Balance Confidence; T25FW: Timed 25 Foot Walk; 6MWT: 6 minute walk test; TUG: Timed Up and Go test; EO: Eyes Open; EC: Eyes Closed; ICC: Intraclass Correlation Coefficient; EDSS: Expanded Disability Status Scale; MFIS: Modified Fatigue Impact Scale; MSWS: Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale; MSIS: Mutliple Sclerosis Impact Scale; PPA: Physiological Profile Assessment; HC: Healthy Control; AP: Anterior-posterior direction; ML: Mediolateral direction.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4306757993","numberInSourceReferences":18,"doi":"10.1371/JOURNAL.PDIG.0000120","title":"Open-source dataset reveals relationship between walking bout duration and fall risk classification performance in persons with multiple sclerosis","authors":[{"id":"A4354303376","orcid":null,"LN":"Meyer","FN":"Brett C.","affil":"University of Vermont (US), University of Massachusetts Lowell (US)"},{"id":"A2742927089","orcid":null,"LN":"Tulipani","FN":"Lindsey J."},{"id":"A2440611622","orcid":"0000-0002-7040-2238","LN":"Gurchiek","FN":"Reed D."},{"id":"A3087576093","orcid":null,"LN":"Allen","FN":"Dakota A."},{"id":"A4306758181","orcid":null,"LN":"Solomon","FN":"Andrew J."},{"id":"A4356623351","orcid":null,"LN":"Cheney","FN":"Nick"},{"id":"A4357244253","orcid":null,"LN":"McGinnis","FN":"Ryan S."}],"year":2022,"journal":"PLOS digital health","references":["W964460774","W1966960212","W1974704788","W1991881145","W2003759089","W2007683147","W2009638659","W2021470828","W2036173927","W2037044719","W2056048847","W2060631420","W2064675550","W2071015042","W2079735306","W2093866254","W2096044210","W2108487302","W2143567192","W2164772540","W2202556201","W2314610170","W2349408014","W2436092751","W2498119267","W2538650175","W2543182432","W2740840999","W2756291343","W2765961644","W2801415007","W2804907753","W2883576155","W2896753463","W2918399910","W2942751529","W2944332588","W2952954391","W2967537207","W2983704835","W2989989029","W2996654865","W3002417609","W3010654752","W3032976522","W3036663690","W3045308527","W3084229205","W3087099853","W3087986832","W3091961298","W3094070409","W3106819768","W3107225396","W3108723210","W3108944498","W3112793364","W3197481331","W4212977478"],"citations":[],"citationsCount":0,"abstract":"Falls are frequent and associated with morbidity in persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Symptoms of MS fluctuate, and standard biannual clinical visits cannot capture these fluctuations. Remote monitoring techniques that leverage wearable sensors have recently emerged as an approach sensitive to disease variability. Previous research has shown that fall risk can be identified from walking data collected by wearable sensors in controlled laboratory conditions however this data may not be generalizable to variable home environments. To investigate fall risk and daily activity performance from remote data, we introduce a new open-source dataset featuring data collected from 38 PwMS, 21 of whom are identified as fallers and 17 as non-fallers based on their six-month fall history. This dataset contains inertial-measurement-unit data from eleven body locations collected in the laboratory, patient-reported surveys and neurological assessments, and two days of free-living sensor data from the chest and right thigh. Six-month (n = 28) and one-year repeat assessment (n = 15) data are also available for some patients. To demonstrate the utility of these data, we explore the use of free-living walking bouts for characterizing fall risk in PwMS, compare these data to those collected in controlled environments, and examine the impact of bout duration on gait parameters and fall risk estimates. Both gait parameters and fall risk classification performance were found to change with bout duration. Deep learning models outperformed feature-based models using home data; the best performance was observed with all bouts for deep-learning and short bouts for feature-based models when evaluating performance on individual bouts. Overall, short duration free-living walking bouts were found to be the least similar to laboratory walking, longer duration free-living walking bouts provided more significant differences between fallers and non-fallers, and an aggregation of all free-living walking bouts yields the best performance in fall risk classification.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W1528523425","numberInSourceReferences":16,"title":"Physical activity engagement in people with Multiple

However, the relevance of changes of these measures in free-living situations and across prolonged observation periods has not been studied. Here, we investigated the minimal detectable change (MDC) of physical activity and gait parameters assessed by accelerometry in eleven patients with MS during their daily activities over a period of one year. MDC of maximum walking speed was constant throughout all measurements, whereas variations of MDC were observed for mean walking speed, steps per day and activity level.
